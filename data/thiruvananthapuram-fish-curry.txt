fish curry
the distinct flavours of coconut and coconum lend a delicious taste to this special thiruvananthapuram delicacy. the kerala meen (fish) curry generally calls for kodampuli, a kind of malabar tamarind, which is soaked in water and added in a sort of runny broth to the dish. the recipe also includes south indian fare staples such as curry leaves, mustard seeds, shallots and green chillies, making the fish curry a fiery addition to any meal.
