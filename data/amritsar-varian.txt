varian
amritsar's old markets are filled with stores selling spices, papad (thin and crisp disc-shaped food) and varians, which are small nuggets of lentils. to prepare varian, lentils are ground into a paste, mixed with spices and then dried in the sun. try adding them to curries for a burst of flavours!
