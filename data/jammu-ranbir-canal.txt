ranbir canal
about 2 km away from jammu is a popular picnic site called the ranbir canal, which is around 60 km long with its distribution systems about 400 km. the vibrant gardens and the lush green area make it one of the most visited tourist attractions in the city. the canal takes off from the left of the chenab river and passes through four taluka of the jammu district. on the right bank of the canal lies a powerhouse and colourful gardens that add to its intrigue. interestingly, even in summer, its waters remain ice cold. the canal was completed in 1905, and remodelled between 1968 and 1975.
