namdrolig-nyingmapa-monastery 
at present, namdroling nyingmapa monastery is the largest teaching centre of nyingmapa, the lineage of tibetan buddhism in the world. the monastery belongs to the sangha community and it is here that the teachings of lord buddha are preserved intact for worldwide propagation. it was founded by his holiness pema norby rinpoche in 1963 as the second seat of the palyul monastery (one of the six great tibet nyingma mother monasteries). the monastery is home to over 5,000 nuns and monks and also has a retreat centre where 30 monks have undergone an intensive three-year retreat. 
 
the namdroling nyingmapa monastery is adorned by several golden paintings. while today it is a resplendent place of worship and meditation, it started off as nothing more than a bamboo structure spread over only 80 sq ft, and will leave one amazed with its monumental transformation.
