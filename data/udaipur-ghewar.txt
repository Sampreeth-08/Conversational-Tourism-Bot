ghewar
a small round sweet cake made with all-purpose flour and soaked in sugar syrup, ghewar is among the most decadent desserts in the city. the generous amount of ghee (clarified butter) used in its preparation is what makes it so delicious. creamy, flaky yet rich, ghewar is usually prepared as a treat on festivities, especially on the festival of raksha bandhan. the malai variant of ghewar is a must-try in udaipur â€“ several shops have been crafting this delicacy for generations and considered as experts.
