prayagraj
description
positioned along the sacred sangam, the confluence of three holy rivers - ganga, yamuna and the mystical saraswati, the city of prayagraj (once known as allahabad), in uttar pradesh, is a popular pilgrimage destination for hindus. one of the four holy cities that play host to the kumbh mela, probably the largest human congregation in the world, prayagraj attracts devotees, holy men, tourists and photographers from all over the world. millions of people arrive here during the maha kumbh that is held at sangam every 12 years and the kumbh that is held every six years.
according to hindu mythology, lord brahma chose a piece of land to perform prakrishta yajna (a fire ritual). the place he chose was where the three holy rivers – ganga, yamuna and saraswati – merged with one another. thus, the city, blessed by the gods, was named teerthraj or prayag.
prayagraj also had a prominent role in india's fight for independence, a legacy that lives on at two palatial mansions - swaraj bhawan and anand bhawan - the erstwhile residences of motilal nehru, the father of independent india's first prime minister,  jawaharlal nehru. swaraj bhawan was also the site of the beginning of mahatma gandhi’s non-violence movement in 1920. today, both the buildings house museums that showcase invaluable artefacts from that time.
