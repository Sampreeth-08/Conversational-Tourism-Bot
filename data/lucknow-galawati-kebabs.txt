galawati kebabs
a truly melt-in-your-mouth dish, galawati kebab or galouti kebab is prepared with finely ground meat and unripe papaya, which is seasoned with a rich blend of spices. egg is used to bind the meat and other ingredients like crushed ginger and garlic, and fried onion, together. this blend is then shaped into thin, round patties and lightly fried in ghee (clarified butter) on a pan. once a golden sizzle is seen on the exterior of the patties, they are taken off the heat and served with a generous helping of raw onions and lemon.
this special dish was curated exclusively for the toothless nawab of lucknow, asaf-ud-daula; since he couldnâ€™t chew. this special version of the regular kebab was created for him in the 16th century, and comprised meat so finely ground and cooked, it would explode in a flavour of meaty deliciousness and spices in the first bite.
