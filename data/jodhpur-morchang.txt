morchang
a morchang is also called a jew's harp. it is a rajasthani folk music instrument, which when played right, hits the right chords with the heart and a musical soul. largely a percussion instrument, morchang features mainly in rajasthani folk songs, or lok geet.
a kind of plucked idiophone, it is primarily made up of a horseshoe-shaped ring, with two parallel knives extending from it. a metal tongue sits in the middle of the main frame, attached to the ring on one end, but free on the other; the tongue is also bent at the end, in a plane perpendicular to the metal ring. when struck, the tongue vibrates, producing the sound that the morchang is so famous for.
