this attraction, located in a cold desert, is only for those who are physically fit and have strong lungs. it lies on both sides of river pin and is known for the breeding of chaumurti horses, which are then sold at rampur-bushahar at the lavi fair and in ladakh. the quality of grass here, along with the lovely climate, ensures that the horses bred are sure-footed and can easily negotiate heights. one can also spot herds of ibex and bharal here. while the entry of foreign tourists is banned, indians need to take a permit from the deputy commissioner shimla or the sub divisional magistrate, rampur, to visit here.
