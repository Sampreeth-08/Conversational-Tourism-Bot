tirupparankundram
the town of tirupparankundram is an important religious centre and is home to one of the six special abodes dedicated to lord murugan or lord subrahmanya. according to legend, the marriage of lord subrahmanya with the daughter of lord indra, devayani, was held at the cave shrine of tirupparankundram, built by the pandiyans in the 8th century. the sanctum sanctorum of the temple has been carved out of a single rock and the walls and pillars are adorned with fascinating carvings. the temple, considered as the fourth pilgrimage of muruga, finds its mention in various classical tamil texts as the southern himalaya where the gods assemble. it is also believed to be a place where the sun and moon abide. since it is believed that murugan married devasena on the hill, the place is considered to be the most auspicious for conducting marriages by the tamil community. the tirupparankundram temple is located at a distance of 8 km from madurai.
