parvati hill
perched at a height of 2,100 ft, parvati hill is home to a popular temple dedicated to goddess parvati. built during the rule of the peshwas (1674-1818), it is said to be the oldest heritage structure in pune. one needs to climb 108 steps to reach this place. parvati hill is an ideal place for devotees, as there are other temples perched on its slopes, including those dedicated to lord devadeshwar, lord vitthal and goddess rukmini, lord vishnu, lord ganesha and lord kartikeya. most of these were built in the 17th century, when nana saheb peshwa was ruling the marathas. tourists can also visit parvati museum that has portraits of peshwa bravehearts, manuscripts, weapons and coins. the temple was once used by the peshwas as a watchtower of sorts, from where they would keep an eye on approaching enemies. local legend has it that the peshwa king, balaji bajirao, observed the battle of kirki from this vantage point, and watched as the british lost and fled. today, tourists can get breathtaking views of the city from this hill.
