fagli
celebrated in the first or second week of february, the festival of fagli sees decorated houses shining in the glow of oil lamps. a 2-foot-tall bamboo stick is mounted on the floor with a white sheet draped across it to make the 'baraza', representing an angel dressed in white adorned with marigold jewellery. various delicacies are placed in front of this guardian angel, who is supposed to bring prosperity. early in the morning, the head of the family and his wife cook totu (dough made with roasted barley and buttermilk) and kwari. whileÂ  totu is taken to the roof and offered to the gods, kwari is fed to hungry crows. the couple also pays respect to sheep and cows as a mark of gratitude. then, they honour the village elders and visit each house with marchu, a local puri (deep-fried flatbread). while the festival is also known as kuns or kus, each of its days has its own name. bullocks, yoke and plough are symbolised with green willow sticks and moved around the room in front of the baraza. there is much feasting and festivity and gifts and marigold flowers are exchanged with loved ones.
