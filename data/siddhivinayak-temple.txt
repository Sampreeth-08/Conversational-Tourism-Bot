a hindu temple dedicated to lord ganesha, the shree siddhivinayak ganapati temple at prabhadevi is a much revered place of worship in mumbai. built in the year 1801, this temple is visited by people belonging to almost all sects of the society. the temple has a small mandapam (hall), where the main idol is enshrined. boasting an exquisite architecture, the sanctum sanctorum has been fitted with wooden doors that have been meticulously carved with the images of the ashtavinayaka or the eight manifestations of lord ganesha. in what is considered an unusual imagery, the templeâ€™s idol was carved out of a single black stone with the trunk positioned towards the right, as opposed to the more commonly seen left-side curl. the idol has four hands known as chaturbhuj. the upper right holds a lotus while the upper left hand holds a small axe. a bowl full of modaks (an indian sweet), along with holy beads can also be seen. the upper floors of the temple host the residential quarters of its priests. though the temple remains crowded throughout the week, it receives the maximum number of devotees on tuesdays. on each side of the ganesha idol are placed one idol each of goddesses riddhi and siddhi, who symbolise sanctity, success, wealth and prosperity. the name 'siddhivinayak' literally translates to ganesha who grants your wish. in the periphery, there is a hanuman temple as well. one of the narrow lanes that lead up to the temple is called the phool gali and has a large number of vendors selling flower garlands, tulsi (basil) leaves, coconuts and sweets, which can be offered to the god.
