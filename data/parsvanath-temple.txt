khajuraho 
parsvanath-temple 
the largest of the jain temples in khajuraho, this shrine is noted for its spectacular tiered construction and intricate sculptures. it belongs to the eastern group of temples and its architecture is quite similar to that of the hindu temples here. 
the temple is believed to have been constructed in the 10th century during the rule of dhangadeva (950-999 ce) of the chandela dynasty. it was previously devoted to the first tirthankara (religious saint) of the jains, adinath. however, in 1860, the image of parsvanath was put in. 
the temple attracts visitors for its intricate architecture and its walls depict the images of elephants, sea nymphs and lions. though it is a jain temple, one can see images of hindu deities like vaishnav as well, on its walls. the temple has some key architectural features like a couple of axial projections at its two ends called the ardh mandapa (the hall) to the east and a small shrine to the west called the garba griha (sanctum sanctorum).
