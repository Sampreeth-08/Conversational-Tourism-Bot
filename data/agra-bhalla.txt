bhalla
fried patties of potato called aloo tikki are agraâ€™s version of bhalla. it is served with chickpea gravy, condiments and green coriander chutney. the tikki is stuffed with moong dal and then fried. once it is sufficiently crisp, it is garnished with pomegranate pearls and grated radish, and served with yoghurt. it is truly a refreshing burst of tangy, sweet and sour flavours in the mouth.
