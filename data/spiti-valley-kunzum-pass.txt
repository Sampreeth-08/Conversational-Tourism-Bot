kunzum pass
at an altitude of 4,590 m, kunzum pass is the point of entry to spiti valley from both lahaul and kullu. at a distance of 20 km from rohtang pass, one needs to take a right turn at gramphoo to reach the pass. while crossing it, you get to witness the enthralling bara-sigri glacier, which is among the longest in the world. while spiti valley lies on one side, one can see numerous peaks of the chandra-bhaga range on the other. spiti riverâ€™s source is also from the kunzum range. a temple and a hut have been recently built at the kunzum pass to provide shelter to passers-by.
