khajuraho
description
if stones could speak, the khajuraho temples would create melodies! situated in madhya pradesh and cradled by the vindhya mountain range, the heritage town of khajuraho is famed for being home to the unesco world heritage site listed temple complex that features hindu and jain houses of worship. these temples are famous for their stunning intricate sculptures depicting different aspects of life: spirituality, love, friendship, sports, royalty and most significantly, awe-inspiring art. based on their geographical location, the temples are categorised into three groups: eastern, western and southern. believed to have been built in a relatively short period of time spanning over 100 years, i.e. between 950-1050 ad, the complex boasts 22 temple structures that remain from the initial group of 85. forgotten for centuries, they were rediscovered in the 1850s and restored.
the temples were conceived and built under the rule of the chandela dynasty. the ornate craftsmanship transforms the life-like sculptures on the temple walls into works of art and is an ode to life, love and joy.
there is an interesting story about how the town got its name. it is said that as the chandela rulers began constructing the temples, they got the entire area enclosed by a wall. the wall had eight gates flanked on either side by khajur or date palm trees, which is found in abundance in this region. the temples were, thus, called khajura vatika, or bearing khajura.
