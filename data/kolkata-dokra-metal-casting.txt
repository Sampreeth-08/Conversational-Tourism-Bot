dokra metal casting
dokra art is a method of making metal artefacts, and is believed to be about 5,000 years old. the dokra kamar tribes have been practising this art for centuries now and it has still retained its popularity. dokra art involves the fashioning of stunning metal figurines made from copper and bronze based alloys, using a lost wax casting. since the process is so tedious and intricate, it may take as long as a month to make a single piece. the first step in the process is creating a core, which is slightly smaller than the final artefact, using clay. it is dried in the sun and given a coat of wax in the desired thickness of the artefact. it is again coated in a layer of clay and intricate designs are carved thereafter. more layers of clay are added afterwards and dried till the mould is hard enough. it is then heated to melt the wax. once the wax comes off, molten metal is poured in the cavity and left to acquire the shape of the clay mould. once the metal cools off, it is dried, and the mould is broken into two or three equal pieces. the artefact is then revealed. since the mould is broken, no two dokra pieces ever look the same. the final step involves applying patina to the metal object. a final coat of wax is then painted to preserve the patina.
