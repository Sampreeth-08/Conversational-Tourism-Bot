chapel-of-our-lady-of-angustias 
considered to be the oldest church in daman, the chapel of our lady of angustias lies right next to the popular moti daman fort, near the football ground. built by a portuguese governor on the grave of agostinho xavier de silva vidigal in the 17th century, the chapel's history dates back to the time when the sultan of bijapur was defeated by portuguese commander alfonso de albuquerque in 1510. today, the church stands as a fine specimen of wooden architecture and craft of portuguese artists. rose petals of various colours adorn the church and the walls are decorated with paintings, depicting the lives of holy saints. the sight of a gold-plated altar with intricate designs is the major attraction of the church.
