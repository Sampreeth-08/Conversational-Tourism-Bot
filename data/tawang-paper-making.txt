paper making
paper making is an art in which the monpas excel. probably they are the only tribe in arunachal pradesh who know the art of making paper. the paper is made from the bark of a shrub called dapne botanical papercia, locally called shugu-sheng. the papers produced by monpas are said to be of very high standard in terms of quality. they use it mainly for religious purposes and most of their religious scriptures are written on handmade papers.
many holy scriptures are written on ornate cardboard, consisting of several sheets of handmade papers pasted together, and varnished with a black pigment, upon which the letters are written in silver or gold.
