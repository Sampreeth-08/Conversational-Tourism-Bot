lansdowne
description
nestled in the secluded mountain ranges of the himalayas, lansdowne, in uttarakhand, is an unspoilt expanse of green. beautiful blue pine forests and thick oaks surround this hill town that is perched at an elevation of about 1,700 m above sea level. dotted with charming churches, overrun by flowering thickets and small ponds, lansdowne has many quaint attractions that add to its relaxed vibe.
named after the then viceroy of india, lord lansdowne, this colonial town is connected with motorable roads, yet is remote on its own. it was established in 1887 as a british cantonment. today, it is the headquarters of the garhwal rifles of the indian army and is dotted with temples and shrines. more importantly, it lies on the way to several significant places like badrinath, hemkund and valley of flowers, while kedarnath and the corbett national park lie nearby.
