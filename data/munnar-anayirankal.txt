anayirankal
anayirankal is noted for its tea plantations. stretching across miles of hills and valleys, the plantations are ideal for a refreshing walk and enjoying the music of nature. there is also a small hydro-electric dam here surrounded by green plantations that tourists can visit. while mornings are abuzz with the activities of the workers at the plantations, the evenings are quiet, spent in the company of cups of tea and a cool breeze. you can also go boating at the reservoir here.
the most special aspect of the dam is the fact that herds of elephants come down from the jungles nearby to the dam to quench their thirst. anayirankal lies on the outskirts of munnar, on the way to thekkady.
