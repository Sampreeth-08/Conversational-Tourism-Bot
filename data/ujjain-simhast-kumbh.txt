ujjain-simhast-kumbh 
kumbh mela is probably the largest spiritual gathering in the world, held in four parts of india - haridwar, ujjain, prayagraj and nashik. it is held every four years in one of the four cities. the fair held in ujjain is called simhasth kumbh mahaparv and is held on the banks of the holy kshipra river. it is widely considered as a hindu pilgrimage in which devotees from all over the globe come together to take a dip in the sacred river. this is in effect to the belief that taking a dip in the waters would absolve them of their sins. the mela itself is a vibrant and awe-inspiring event and a great place to soak in culture and tradition. 
 
there is an interesting story behind the origin of this popular festival. the gods (devtas) and demons (asuras) were fighting over a pot of nectar (kalasha of amrit) that they had found during the churning of the primordial sea (samudra mathan). since the demons were more powerful, the gods entrusted the pot of nectar to four devtas - brahaspati, surya, chandra and shani, who ran away with it to keep it safe. the demons chased after them for 12 days and nights around the earth. during the chase, the gods kept the pot at haridwar, prayag, ujjain and nasik. another legend says that a fight ensued between the gods and demons in which the pot tipped over, and the nectar fell at these four places.
