sel roti
these are flat round bread doughnuts made from rice paste and then deep-fried. commonly prepared at local homes during private functions or parties, sel roti is usually served with butter, cheese or chutney. this roti is sweet in taste, and is prepared in large quantities during the festivals of dashain and tihar, widely celebrated in the town of darjeeling.
the dough is prepared by adding milk, sugar, bananas, cardamom, ghee, butter and other flavours of choice to rice flour. this mixture is then poured into hot oil and deep fried until golden and crispy.Â since darjeeling enjoys cool weather almost throughout the year, sel roti can stored for almost 20 days. therefore, it is given as a gift to friends and family during special occasions.
