rain shields and headgear
tripura is the land of skilled artisans and craftsmen, who make pathla, an intricately designed circular-shaped rain shield, with great finesse. its top cone has a base of 230 mm and a height of 110 mm. the circular shade is angled slightly downwards and mostly has a diameter of 550 mm. it resembles a pentagon made of five elements, each of which has three strips of bamboo encircling the apex of the cone. the subsequent hexagons on the cone are also made with three strips of each element. five wide interlocking strips of bamboo strengthen the apex of the cone. these strips are held in place by introducing them into the weave on the cone.the locals excel in crafting headgear, which is made of brass and coloured cane and embellished with porcupine quills, feathers of parrots and red wool. this headgear is used specifically during folk dance performances.
