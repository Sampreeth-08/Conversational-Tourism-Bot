st-patrick-s-church 
considered to be the largest church in dalhousie, st patrick's church takes pride of place in the historic cantonment area around which the entire town is spread. the architecture of the church is dominated by a majestic prayer hall that can easily accommodate up to 300 people. the foundation of this church was laid in 1909 by the officers of the british indian army. surrounded by towering trees of deodar and rhododendron, the church is nestled amongst rolling pine valleys. not unlike other colonial-era churches, st. patrick's church is also maintained by the catholic diocese of jalandhar. exuding an aura of serenity and filled with an old-world charm, the church still functions as a place of worship with many flocking to its doors every sunday. located only three km from the main bus stand in dalhousie, a visit to the church requires a special permission.
