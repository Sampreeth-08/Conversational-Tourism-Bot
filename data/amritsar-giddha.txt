performed by women, giddha involves performers standing in a circle, while one woman sits in the centre and plays the dhol (double-headed drum). the dance form is a representation of the life of women in rural punjab and is performed during festive occasions of sowing and reaping the harvest. as per legend, giddha originated from the ring dance that was quite prevalent in punjab in ancient times.
