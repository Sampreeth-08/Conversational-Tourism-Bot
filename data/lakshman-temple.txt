khajuraho 
lakshman-temple 
located in the western group of temples in the khajuraho complex, the lakshman temple is considered to be the oldest and the most aesthetically pleasing. it was one of the first temples built by the chandela kings, and the patron of this temple is believed to be yashovarman, who gained control over areas in the bundelkhand region of central india. yashovarman sought to build this temple to mark his rule over these territories. however, he died before the construction was completed and his son, dhanga, took over the work and dedicated the temple in 954 ce. 
the temple showcases the trinity of lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord shiva. built on a high platform, it is made in a tiered format with intricately carved columns. 
the main idol of the temple is an image of lord vishnu in a three-headed avatar called vaikuntha. it is placed in the inner chamber known as garba griha (sanctum sanctorum), which is an architectural feature of most hindu temples. 
the building of the temple reflects a nagara style of architecture, owing to the flat-roofed entry porch called mandapa and a shrine called vimana. the shrine of nagara temples comprises a base platform and a superstructure called shikhara (spire).
