lassi
lassi, a popular yoghurt-based drink is the most pleasing way to end a typical varanasi breakfast. it is traditionally served in a kullhad (earthen glass) with a thick dollop of cream, often flavoured with rose water and generously garnished with condiments like cardamom. bhaang, which is cannabis mixed in milk, is also a popular beverage here, especially consumed during the maha shivratri festival.
