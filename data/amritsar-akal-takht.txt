akal takht
akal takht is one of the five seats of the sikh religious authority. the word 'akal' translates into timeless one and 'takht' means throne. thus, akal takht literally means the throne of the immortal. it was built by the sixth guru of the sikhs, guru hargobind ji, who laid the foundation stone in 1605. the takht was a symbol against the tyranny of the rulers and represented justice in the 17th and 18th centuries. it is the highest seat of the khalsa, which is a military and civil authority of the sikhs. the weaponry that was used by sikh warriors in those times is also housed here. the takht is situated within the golden temple complex. the building faces the darshini deorhi, which then leads to the temple.
