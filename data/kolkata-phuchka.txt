phuchka
popularly called as golgappa and pani puri in other parts of india, phuchka is the street staple of kolkata's culinary scene. puchkas are crisp and fried puris that are filled with mashed potatoes, tamarind pulp, black chana and flavoured with red chilli, cumin powder, black salt. almost all streets seem to be lined with vendors selling tamarind water-filled phuchkas. it is said that phulkis (a precursor to phuchka) originated in magadh, which was one of the 16 mahajanapadas (current day bihar). these then evolved to the delectable phuchka that is eaten with such relish today.
