trekking
the beautiful sahyadri range provides the ideal location for adventure seekers. trekkers can go to rajmachi, a small village in the mountains that is known for the forts of shrivardhan and manaranjan. both the forts provide impressive views of the surrounding greenery. the fort of rajmachi was used to protect the historic trade route of bor ghat. located at an altitude of more than 2,700 ft, it is a protected monument and one of the most popular attractions in the area.
other favourites among trekkers are lonavala (lohagad fort), bhandardara (kalsubai peak), sinhagad fort, matheran (garbett or garbut point), satara (vasota, and chandan-vandan forts), among several others. trekking packages are available almost throughout the year, so visitors will always have a plethora of options to choose from.
