lhalung
an hourâ€™s drive from lingti valley is the town of lhalung. with pretty yellows of rapeseed and barley dotting the landscape, this beautiful place adds to the pretty shades of spiti valley. the main attraction is the lhalung monastery that lies near the top of the village and looks like an antique gem despite its modest structure. its main chapel (serkhang gompa) lies beneath a painted yellow tin roof and the interior walls boast a beautiful array of vibrant and colourful mud-plaster sculptures. they are so old that some believe that they were made by god and not man. this monastery is one of the oldest in the valley and lies at an elevation of 3,658 m above sea level. in the vicinity is the langkharpo chapel that has a distinct four-sided statue of the white deity, situated atop a podium of snow lions.
