mukteswara-temple 
built sometime around 950 ad, the mukteswara temple is often referred to as a miniature gem of odishan architecture. its design marks a transition point between the early and later phases of the kalinga school of architecture. due to this, many historians call this temple a harbinger of new culture. the temple is dedicated to goddess saraswati, lord ganesha and lord shiva, whose shrines have been installed here. the latticed windows of the jagmohana (porch) resemble those of the parsurameswara temple in the city. a highlight of the temple are the sculptures, such as those around the windows of the jagmohana that depict monkeys engaged in humorous scenes from the ancient indian stories of panchatantra. since the temple is relatively small in size, 35 ft high at the pinnacle of the tower, it becomes evident that it is an old structure as by that time odishan builders had'nt attempted to build larger temples.
