patnitop is not just known for its natural beauty but is also a haven for shoppers. the small hill station is noted for dry fruits, dogra jewellery, handicrafts and paintings from kashmir, and exquisite pashmina shawls in a plethora of colours. do not miss taking home souvenirs from shops near the naag temple; the objects sold at the temple are depictions of ancient times, and are as eccentric as they are lovely. for the young shopper, patnitop has a lot to offer. you can pick up trendy clothes, shoes, junk jewellery and other similar items for very affordable prices.
