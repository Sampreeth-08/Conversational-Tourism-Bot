monkey-temple 
dedicated to lord hanuman, the monkey god, the monkey temple is a popular attraction of hampi. it is a coracle ride away from the main ruins in the city, across tungabhadra, and is situated on the anjaneya hill. folklore says it marks the birthplace of lord hanuman. according to hindu mythology, lord hanuman was born to mata anjana and thus, was named anjaneya, with his birthplace being called anjaneyadri (meaning anjaneya's hill). sitting atop the hill, the temple is visible from a distance, with a trail of stairs leading up to it. keep around 40 minutes in hand to climb up. the temple has an image of lord hanuman carved on a rock and a small shrine inside has been made for lord rama and goddess sita. the view from the top is breathtaking as the temple overlooks green paddy fields, coconut tree plantations and the ruins stretching into the horizon. the entire area is encircled by rugged mountains and a raging river adds to its pristine beauty.
