maya-devi-temple 
this temple is dedicated to goddess maya devi and is one of the three shaktipeethas (devotional shrines where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell) in haridwar, about 53 km away. the other two are chandi devi and mansa devi temples. legend has it that once king daksh prajapati was having a holy yajna (a fire ritual). however, he failed to invite his son-in-law lord shiva to the ceremony. offended, his daughter, goddess sati immolated herself in her father's yajna. lord shiva was grieved and enraged and began pacing the universe and performing his dance of cosmic destruction, tandava. fearing that he would destroy everything in his path, lord vishnu severed the body of sati with his chakra. it is believed that the heart and navel of the goddess fell at this temple. 
 
the temple premises host the idols of goddess maya, goddess kamakhya and goddess kali. the temple is particularly crowded during the navratri festival (a holy nine-day period) and the kumbh mela.
