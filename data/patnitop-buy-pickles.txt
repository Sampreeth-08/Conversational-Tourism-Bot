buy pickles
pickles in jammu are a favoured item. the home-made recipe includes kasrod (fiddlehead fern) and mango with saunf (fennel), zimikand (elephant foot yam), chillies, radish, carrot, beans and potatoes. taking home some of these is a must when you visit patnitop. according to legend, it was the royal dogra dynasty, who ruled the state of jammu and kashmir from the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, who reinforced the tradition of pickle-making here. the wives of the dogra warriors would prepare delicious dishes for their battle-worn husbands upon their return, and would preserve pickles for a long time; pickles therefore gained a special place in the royal kitchen.
