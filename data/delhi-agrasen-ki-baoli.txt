agrasen ki baoli
a quaint and serene spot amidst the bustle of delhi, agrasen-ki-baoli, gives a peek into the history of the capital. it is a 60-m-long and a 15-m-wide historical step well. its heritage character, intricate structure and tranquil ambience have endeared it to film-makers as well and the monument has often been a cinematic backdrop, featured in movies like sultan and pk. as you descend the deep stepwell, you can suddenly feel the cool embrace you. it might even send a chill down your spine as you recall that the monument was once believed to be haunted. legend has it that the water in the baoli was said to be full of black magic and anyone who looked at it would get into a trance and jump to certain death. the baoli (step well) has 108 steps and three levels with arched niches on both sides.
today, it is a protected monument by the archaeological survey of india (asi). there are hardly any historical records to provide information about its creator but it is believed that it was built by legendary king agrasen and rebuilt by the agrawal community in the 14th century.
