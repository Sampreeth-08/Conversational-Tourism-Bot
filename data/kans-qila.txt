kans-qila 
believed to be the palace of demon kansa, the maternal uncle of lord krishna, kans qila is situated on the banks of river yamuna. its partial ruins still reflect its former grandeur and one can see traces of a blend of hindu and muslim architectural styles, given that it came under different rules over the centuries. after exchanging several hands, the palace was finally renovated by raja man singh of jaipur during the 16th century. 
an observatory is said to have been added in the complex by maharaja sawai jai singh (1699-1743) later, but thereâ€™s no sign of it now. the old audience hall, located outside the fort, is particularly alluring, with its towering red sandstone pillars. the fort was earlier used as a barrier against floods as it is located on the northern bank of river yamuna. it is open all days of the year to the public, but the best time to visit is between the months of october and march, when the temperature dips.
