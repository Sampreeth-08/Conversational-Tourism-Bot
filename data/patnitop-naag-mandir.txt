naag mandir
the 600-year-old naag mandir sits on top of a hill in mantalai and is said to be the place where lord shiva married goddess parvati. the temple is dedicated to naag devta (serpent god), and people come here to worship snakes and offer prayers and sweets to the deity. surrounded by lush greenery and snow-covered mountain peaks, the temple is visited by thousands of pilgrims during the naag panchami festival, when snakes are traditionally worshipped.
