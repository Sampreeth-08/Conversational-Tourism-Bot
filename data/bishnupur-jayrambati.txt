it is the birthplace of the holy mother sri sri sarada devi. the sri sri matri mandir temple, built in 1923 by sree saradanandji, is a popular attraction. the 45-ft-high temple has a white spire with the engraving of the word ‘ma’. it gives a glimpse of the life and teachings of the holy mother. the deity in the temple lies exactly at the same spot where sri sri sarada devi was born. near the temple is a holy pond, which was used by sri sri ma. devotees now take a dip in it as they believe it to be auspicious.
