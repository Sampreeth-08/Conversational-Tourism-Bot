odisha is home to several varieties of distinctive handwoven textiles, including cotton and silk sarees. the state is famous for its silk ikat sarees that are created by an age-old process in which the warp and weft yarns are tied and dyed to produce a distinct pattern while weaving. taking inspiration from nature and temples, these sarees are bright in colour and feature bold patterns. sambalpur, berhampur, mayurbhanj and nuapatna are famous for producing tassar silk.
the rare silk fabric produced at nuapatna is embellished with verses from the gitagovinda and is used to adorn the idols at the jagannath temple. the masters are well versed with the centuries old art of silk worm cultivation and create silk ties, stoles, furnishings and dress materials, and sarees. the berhampuri pata is a heavy silk saree with a narrow border and simple design. the saktapar saree, from sambalpur, is double ikat patterned with brocade border. the popular bomkai cotton saree from the ganjam district has strong influences of tribal art and temple architecture.
