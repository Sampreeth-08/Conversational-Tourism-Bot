san thomas basilica
a beautiful roman catholic cathedral in pristine white, this church has a portuguese origin, and dates back to the 16th century. it was rebuilt in neo-gothic style in 1896 and is said to be the final resting place of st thomas, the apostle. a small cross on the tomb wall contains a tiny bone fragment referred to as the ‘relic of st thomas’. an underground tomb chapel is worshipped here and the devout believe that sand from the tomb has miraculous healing powers. a beautiful stained glass window at the basilica portrays the story of st thomas and the central hall has 14 wooden plaques that depict the stations of the cross. the cathedral also has a 3-ft-high statue of virgin mary believed to have been brought from portugal in 1543.
