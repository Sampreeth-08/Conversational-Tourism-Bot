safed maas
safed maas is a mughal preparation that is a traditional rajasthani delicacy. it is a mutton-based dish that has a luscious texture. it draws its white colour from khoya, fresh cream and yoghurt. its gravy, which is an amalgamation of onion, cashew nut paste, cardamom, salt, pepper, ginger and garlic paste, is what makes it so delicious.
