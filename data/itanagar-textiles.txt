textiles
making textiles is another famous activity that the tribes of arunachal pradesh indulge in. the use of colours and designs are unique to every tribe. the motifs woven on the fabric are inspired by neighbouring areas and are geometric and complex with their own symbolic meanings. carpet making is a speciality of the monpas tribe, who weave lovely designs with dragon, floral and geometric patterns. though this started as a product to use in daily life, today it has become a major occupation for some ladies here.
