kebab
kebabs were initially made in turkish kitchens and brought to india by the afghans. they became popular during the mughal period and today, they have become one of the most versatile dishes in the country. made from minced meat and flavoured with aromatic indian spices, cotton-soft kebabs in delhi are mouthwatering. there are many variations available of the succulent kebabs: kakori kebabs are cooked with mutton and flavoured with mint; shammi kebabs are prepared with mutton/chicken and are melt-in-the-mouth soft; reshmi kebabs are prepared with minced chicken that is cooked over charcoal; sutli kebabs are made by moulding a paste of meat and spices around a skewer and then letting it cook. the process of preparing kebabs is an interesting one. they are wrapped around skewers, which are placed on charcoal. once cooked, a few drops of lemon are added to them and they can be eaten with the soft rumali roti and onions.
