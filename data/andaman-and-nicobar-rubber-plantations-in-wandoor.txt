rubber plantations in wandoor
since rubber is one of the most significant cultivations on the islands, there are many spots that one can visit to see how the manufacturing process unfolds. the rubber plantation in wandoor is one of the most scenic places and the largest in andaman, with an area of about 931 hectare. it has around ten thousand trees and lies in the south andaman region. as one enters, one can see thousands of golden rubber sheets and collecting jars fitted on each tree. a guided tour offers information on the process of converting raw rubber into sheets. the process called tapping involves the collection of rubber from trees. the rubber is then rolled into sheets through manual rollers. the whole procedure is indeed very fascinating.
