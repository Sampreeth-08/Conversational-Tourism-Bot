dumna nature park
located just 10 km from the city of jabalpur, the dumna nature park is an eco-tourism spot. it is home to a wide variety of wild animals, including jackal, spotted deer, leopard, wild boar and porcupine. the park also hosts a number of migratory birds during winters, and thus invites birdwatchers from across the region. it has been developed as a family stopover, with an entertaining children's park, a restaurant and a fishing platform. tracks for cycling and walking have been designated here, enabling visitors to enjoy a spurt of physical exercise if they so wish. there is also a toy train service, which is quite popular with kids. the nature park also includes the khandari water reservoir, which is as picturesque as it is soothing.
