rishikund
a natural hot water spring, literally meaning the pond of the sage, rishikund lies close to the popular triveni ghat. legend has it that during ancient times, the holy ganga stopped flowing, which created a drought in the region. to please mother ganga, devotees and saints performed yagya (a sacred fire ritual) and at their request goddess yamuna (believed to be yamuna river that is considered the second-most sacred river in the country) herself appeared. it is said that she stayed here forever after that, removing all traces of the drought. another folklore says that rishikund was the place where lord rama used to bathe. the raghunath temple, dedicated to lord rama and goddess sita, stands beside rishikund, and invites devotees from all around the region.
