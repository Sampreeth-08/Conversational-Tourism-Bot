one of the principal ports of kutch and gujarat, mandvi is a treasure trove of trade and sea voyage secrets. situated about 58 km from bhuj, it was established as a port town by the king of kutch in 1574. here, one can visit the shipbuilding yards along river rukmavati to see wooden ships being built by hand till today. its 400-year-old tradition of ship-making is unique. the ships are called dhows and are completely made by hand.
another feature of interest is a visit to the tower of wagers, where wealthy ship owners once waited for their fleets to return. an unmissable site is the vijay vilas palace, which was built by rao vijayrajji in 1929. its unique antiques and exhibits are quite amazing. in fact, many indian movies such as lagaan and hum dil de chuke sanam have also been shot here. mandvi is also blessed with quiet beaches where one can spot flamingos and other migratory birds. the popular mandvi beach is located at a point where the rukmavati river joins the arabian sea. tourists can also sample the tasty double rotis or dabelis (a delectable snack) that are quite popular here.
