dehradun
description
lying at the foothills of the majestic snow-capped shivalik range, amidst verdant and lush sal forests, the quaint hill station of dehradun, in uttarakhand, is the heart of the garhwal region. cut by two perennial rivers, dehradun is a favourite with travellers looking for a serene natural retreat and also offers a wide array of terrains to trek through and indulge in activities like mountain climbing, paragliding, skiing, river rafting, angling and cycling, among others.
located in the scenic doon valley, dehradun is a great launching pad for exploring destinations like mussoorie, in the garhwal region. the city derives its name from the conjunction of two colloquial words, ‘dera’ meaning camp, and ‘doon’, a reference to the river valley.
home to a number of spiritual sites set against the stunning backdrop of the mountains, dehradun is believed to be one of the oldest cities in the country. legend has it that lord rama, along with his brother, lakshmana, performed penance here for killing ravana.
the british occupation of dehradun in 1815 left a lasting impact on the city, which is visible in its various colonial buildings, even today.
