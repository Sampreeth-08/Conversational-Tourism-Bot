wood carving
this is a traditional craft of most tribes of arunachal pradesh like the monpas, khamtis, wanchos, phom and konyak. while wancho woodcarvers have a good sense of proportion, their monpa counterparts make beautiful cups, dishes, fruit bowls along with magnificent masks that are used for ceremonial dances and pantomimes. the monpa, sherdukpen, khampa tribes make masks of various styles. some of them look like real faces while others represent birds, animals and apes with twisted mouths. the masks are carved out of a single block of wood that is hollowed from the inside. holes are made for eyes and mouths and then the masks are painted. however, the older masks have been found to be discoloured and dark. often, maks are worn by men and boys only.
