baluchari sarees
a visit to bishnupur is incomplete without buying beautiful baluchari sarees, which are a hallmark of the region. known for carrying elaborate motifs on the border and pallu, they were first made in a small village called baluchar, in murshidabad district. the nawab of bengal, murshidkuli khan, brought the craft to baluchar from dhaka (now in bangladesh) and encouraged local weavers to practice the art of weaving these sarees. the industry moved to bishnupur after a massive flood left baluchar village submerged.
