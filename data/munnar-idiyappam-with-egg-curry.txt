idiyappam with egg curry
idiyappam is made of rice flour, shaped like long noodles and then steamed. rice flour, grated coconut, salt and water are added to make this. the dish has a plain yet delicate texture with the strands being entwined together to make balls. idiyappam is usually served with egg curry or egg roast, but all kinds of curries complement it well. egg roast for this dish is prepared with hard-boiled eggs, onions, green chillies, tomatoes, red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, garam masala and a paste of ginger-garlic, along with curry leaves and mustard seeds. this dish is truly an amalgamation that one should not miss out on.
