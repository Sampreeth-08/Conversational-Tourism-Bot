nubra-valle
description
an oasis of green, surrounded by mighty mountains that sport every shade of brown, the deep nubra valley in ladakh is nature's dramatic encore. stark yet stunning, with vast stretches of arid sand dunes, ancient ruins and serene buddhist monasteries, nubra is a popular tourist destination. lying about 150 km from the town of leh, the valley is perched at the confluence of rivers shyok and siachen. with undulating sand dunes marking the cold desert, one can spot the unique double-humped bactrian camels here. the valley is also home to the famous pashmina goat.
panamik village, nestled closed to the siachen glacier, makes for a great stopover. diskit monastery, yarab tso lake, maitreya buddha, samstanling monastery and khardung la pass are some of the other major attractions here.
