pavnar ashram
lying on the outskirts of the city, pavnar is a serene and spiritual stopover. tourists can explore the remains of a medieval fort that stands as a testament to the artistic genius of the artists of the vakataka dynasty (250 ad to 500 ad), which made pavnar their capital. the most popular attraction is the paramdham ashram that was established by acharya vinoba bhave, founder of the bhoodan movement, in 1934. excavations carried out during the construction of the ashram revealed numerous sculptures and idols belonging to different periods between 250 ad and 1200 ad, which are displayed at the ashram. these include the sculptures of goddess ganga and other sculptures depicting scenes from epics like the mahabharata and the ramayana.
the most striking is the one depicting the meeting of lord rama with his brother bharata. on the way to the pavnar ashram, tourists can also visit two temples dedicated to lord vishnu and lord hanuman, respectively. the ashram is also home to the brahma vidya mandir that was established by acharya vinoba bhave, an indian advocate of human rights, and is now run by women from all parts of india. a visit to the ashram introduces tourists to the life and works of acharya vinoba bhave.
