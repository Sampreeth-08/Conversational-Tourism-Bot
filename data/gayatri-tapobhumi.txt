gayatri-tapobhumi 
this temple was established in 1950 with holy soil gathered from 2,400 pilgrimage sites by pandit shriram sharma acharya (gurudev), after he concluded the 24 gayatri mahapurascharan, where each mahapurascharan involves the recitation of 2.4 million gayatri mantras every year! the place is also home to one of the largest religious families of india – the gayatri pariwar. 
within the temple, a large yagnashala holds the akhand agni, a sacred flame said to have been lit over 700 years ago by a saint. along with an idol of gayatri, the religious site also securely holds the mantras recited by gurudev. in 1958, a yagya (a fire ritual) was held at the yagnashala, marking the initiation of the gayatri mission, post which over a 1,000 centres propagating gurudev’s message and educating devotees, were set up. as more and more students joined, the main building of the temple was extended to include the prajanagar, or housing for growing population at tapobhumi. 
on the occasion of its golden anniversary, the images of pujyaniya guruji, and vandaniya mataji were installed at gayatri tapobhumi. you can pick up any of the several books written by gurudev during his lifetime for only the cost of publishing here.
