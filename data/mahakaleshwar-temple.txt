mahakaleshwar-temple 
one of the 12 jyotirlingas in the country and among the most prominent temples in ujjain, mahakaleshwar temple is dedicated to lord shiva. the lingam (a symbolic representation of lord shiva) at mahakaleshwar resides in a subterranean chamber and is believed to be swayambhu or self-manifested. the present temple is a five-storey structure and was constructed midway during the 18th century. built in bhumija, chalukya and maratha styles of architecture, the temple is an architectural marvel. of note are its marble walkways that were restored in the latter half of the 19th century by the scindias. three floors of the building are occupied by lingams of mahakalesvara, omkaresvara and nagachandresvara, respectively. the nagachandresvara lingam is accessible for devotees only on the occasion of naga panchami. there is also a kunda (tank) in the premises called koti tirtha that has been built in the sarvatobhadra style. on the path from the stairs of the kunda to the temple you will come across several images of the original structure of the temple, reflecting its grandeur during the period of the paramaras (9th and 14th centuries). located near rudra sagar, the temple holds a special bhasma arti for which devotees gather here as early as 4 am. there is an enthusiastic vibe in the air and the lit diyas make for a stunning sight.
