idli
idlis are round cakes made from a batter of steamed rice and fermented black lentils. sometimes, fenugreek is added to the batter to give it more flavour. idlis are a popular, sort-of staple food in south indian states. idlis are soft and chewy, but a bit bland on their own; complement them with coconut chutney or a spicy curry, and hot sambar. there are variations of idli across the country, like rava, sanna, enduri pitha, etc.
