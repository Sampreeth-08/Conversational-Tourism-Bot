this 100-year-old roman catholic basilica located on a hillock in bandra overlooks the arabian sea. it attracts devotees from all faiths who come to pray and seek blessings from mother mary. the church has been built in the neo-gothic style of architecture. there are seven steps in white marble that lead the eye of the visitor to the statue of mother mary holding her son jesus christ in her right hand. the wooden statue is crowned with a white and gold veil that flows down to the topmost marble step. the murals depict scenes from the life of mary. although the current church edifice is relatively modern, the history behind the statue of our lady goes back to the 16th century when jesuit priests from portugal brought the statue to the current location and constructed a chapel. a week-long festival takes place here in september to celebrate mother maryâ€™s birthday. known as the bandra fair, thousands of devotees come here during that time to partake in the festive activities that take place in and around the beautifully decorated church. many stalls selling religious artefacts, curios, candles and baked goodness are also set up.
