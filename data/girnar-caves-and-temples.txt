for generations, mt girnar has been an important pilgrimage site in the state of gujarat. older than the himalayas, it houses a number of jain and hindu temples that are spread over five different summits. 
visitors can reach the summit via a flight of steps that begin at damodar kund. embarking on this trek is a memorable experience as you get spectacular views of the surroundings. as the pilgrims ascend the stone path, which links the five summits, they cross a number of ancient temples belonging to different sects of hinduism. then, they come across a complex of jain temples on a plateau that is equally fascinating. it is said that at one of these places, the 22nd tirthankar (saint) of jainism died after 700 years of ascetic meditation. most visitors arrive here during the girnar parikrama festival and mahashivaratri festival, which see grand celebrations.
