kanak bhawan
built by teekamgarhs (now madhya pradesh) queen, vrishbhanu kumari, the beautiful temple of kanak bhawan is dedicated to lord rama and his consort, goddess sita. bearing a stark resemblance to the opulent palaces of rajasthan and bundelkhand region, the temple is sometimes referred to as sone-ke-ghar mandir.
legend has it that the temple was gifted to goddess sita by lord rama's stepmother, queen kaikayi, when she arrived in ayodhya after her marriage to lord rama. the temple's central hall boasts arched doorways on three sides and its sanctum sanctorum houses gold crowned idols of lord rama and goddess sita. the idols are beautifully decorated with heavy gold ornaments, which is why the temple is called kanak bhawan, �kanak� meaning gold. the temple can be visited on all days of the week from 8 am to 11.30 am and from 4.30 pm to 9 pm.
