gwalior 
chaturbhuj-mandir 
carved into a sheer rock face, chaturbhuj temple, also known as the temple of the four armed lord, stands on the eastern approach to the gwalior fort. dedicated to lord vishnu, the temple is said to have been constructed in 876 bc. it is most famous for the worldâ€™s oldest known zero inscribed onto stone. inside the temple, there is an idol of lord vishnu and the inscription with the zero. there are two figures of zero inscribed and the custodian of the temple or a tour guide can point them out. while the eastern approach to the fort is a tough climb and the cobbled path can't be traversed by car, one can also come down halfway from the top of the fort to see the temple.
