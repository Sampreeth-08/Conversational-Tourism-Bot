taj-ul-masjid 
one of the largest mosques in the country, taj-ul-masjid, whose name literally translates into crown among mosques, is sprawled over an area of 23,912 sq ft. it is a fine example of mughal architecture, comparable to the iconic jama masjid in delhi. it boasts a broad pink fa√ßade, spacious courtyards, smooth marble flooring and an inter-arched roof. the minarets rise to a height of 67 m. the mosque has 27 interlinked ceilings, 16 of which are adorned with petal motifs. every year, a three-day congregation used to be organised at taj-ul-masjid, but it has since moved to islam nagar because its popularity grew so much that even the large mosque proved too small for hosting the event. 
 
the masjid's construction was started by nawab shah jahan begum (1868-1901). his daughter, sultan jahan begum, continued its construction throughout her lifetime. after remaining in a dormant state for decades, its construction began once again in 1971 and ended in 1985.
