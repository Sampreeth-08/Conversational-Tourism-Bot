kumbakkarai waterfalls
the serene and scenic kumbakkarai waterfalls, about 100 km from madurai, are a beautiful picnic spot, nestled in the kodaikanal hills. set against a picturesque backdrop, these two-tier gushing falls are a delightful sight and also serve as a basecamp for trekkers venturing into the hills of kodai. the first stage involves collection of water in huge rock recesses, which have been named after different wild animals like tiger, elephant, snake, etc. water from the pambar river then flows down to the second stage before it falls as the main waterfall. tourists can also visit a nearby temple dedicated to goddess thadagai nachiamman. the temple is believed to be 500 years old. the sirumalai amusement park, located at a distance of 7 km from the fall is also worth visiting.
