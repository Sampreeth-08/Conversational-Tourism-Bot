varanasi 
harish-chandra-ghat 
harish chandra ghat is one of the two cremation ghats and is also known as adi manikarnika, which means the original creation ground. it is much smaller than manikarnika that is a more significant ghat for cremation. however, hindus come from distant places to this ghat to have their dead cremated here as many believe that they would get moksha (salvation). this is one of the oldest ghats in the holy city of varanasi and has been named after mythological king harish chandra. it is said that the king once worked on this ghat for the perseverance of truth and charity. the gods impressed with his endeavours rewarded him and restored his lost kingdom and dead son to him. the ghat was modernised in 1980s when an electric crematorium was established here.
