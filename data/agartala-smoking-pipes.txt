smoking pipes
smoking pipes are made by the riang tribe of tripura and are generally used to smoke tobacco. in a typical pipe, a clay bowl is connected by a short bamboo tube to a bamboo water container. the container has a fairly large diameter and the length includes two internodes. the central nodal diaphragm is knocked out, while the lower node is retained to become the water container. the short bamboo tube, made from a small diameter bamboo, penetrates into the container to end below the water level. the other end receives the clay bowl in which the tobacco is burnt.
