nillai tea garden
a visit to the beautiful state of manipur gives tourists an opportunity to explore lush green tea estates and try aromatic flavours of black and green teas grown in the region. situated on hallui hills, nillai tea garden is one such tea estate that attracts visitors in large numbers for its rich variety of tea and its special green tea. tourists can take a guided tour of the tea estate and learn about the process that goes behind making tea. the guide from the tea estate will show you how hand-plucked tea leaves are sun dried and then naturally processed by locals. the speciality of the green tea at the nillai tea garden is that its authentic flavour can be tasted only after it is boiled twice. surrounded by verdant hillocks and dotted with patches of greenery, the mist-covered tea garden is an absolute delight for nature-lovers and people who have a special corner for tea in their hearts.
