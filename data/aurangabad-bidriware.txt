bidriware
bidriware is the pride of bidar, near aurangabad, and is an indigenous handicraft tradition that garners a lot of admiration and appreciation. practised on zinc and copper, and inlaid with pure silver or thin sheets, it is a delicate art and remarkably intricate. bidri items can be found in most arts and crafts shops of hyderabad and regular tours are organised by local heritage tour companies to bidar, where visitors can watch the artisans at work.
the origin of this art form is believed to have been during the reign of the bahmani sultans, who ruled bidar in the 14th and 15th centuries. it is said to be an amalgamation of persian, arabic and turkish designs. though there are no historical records to prove it, many believe that it was brought to india by the followers of khwaja muinuddin chisty, a preacher, in the 12th century.
