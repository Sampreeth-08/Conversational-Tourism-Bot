darjeeling 
observatory-hill 
as the name suggests, observatory hill is one of the best spots from where you can get a panoramic view of the resplendent natural beauty of darjeeling. it is located in the mall area of darjeeling, and its highest point is only a 15-minute uphill walk. 
 
it was the original site of the dorje ling monastery, and is therefore quite significant for the buddhist community that thrives here. a hindu shrine known as the mahakal temple, which houses the protector deity according to buddhism, has been set up at the highest point. 
 
there are three shivlings at the temple, said to have self-manifested in 1785. these represent the holy trinity - lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord mahesh. 
 
apart from this, the summit has a number of shrines, dedicated to lord hanuman and siddhi sai baba, and a flurry of colourful prayer flags along with the pleasant sounds of devotional bells, providing the perfect frame for your holiday memories. as you walk up to the main temple, your path will often be intercepted by playful monkeys that call this hill home.
