kanchipuram idli
made from rice or suji (semolina), idlis in kanchipuram are best enjoyed with sambar and coconut chutney. to make idlis look more colourful and flavourful, different spices and vegetables are added. ghee (clarified butter) is sometimes poured on top of hot idlis so that they melt in your mouth in an explosion of flavour and goodness.
