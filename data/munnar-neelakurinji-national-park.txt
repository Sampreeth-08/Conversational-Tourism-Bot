neelakurinji national park
munnar turns into a fairyland every time the blooming season comes around and the beautiful neelakurinji flower covers the landscape in blue and purple. this rare beauty can be seen flowering in this locale once every 12 years. thousands of travellers crowd munnar during blooming season when the hills are all draped and look even prettier. neelakurinji is a shrub mostly found in the western ghats of south india. its habitat is specifically confined to the shola grasslands in the ghats—the nilgiri hills, palani hills and the eravikulam hills of munnar.
the government of kerala established this park for the conservation and preservation of this unique sample of biodiversity. the initiative’s primary objective is to protect neelakurinji. the park sprawls across 7,907 acre of land, across the villages of kottakamboor and vattavada. the blooming season is so widely awaited that people make bookings to visit and stay months, even years in advance. if you are planning to visit at this time, do check the hotel availability well in time.
