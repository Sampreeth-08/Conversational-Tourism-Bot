khurchan
it is a sweet dish prepared with boiling milk. when milk is churned as it boils, the froth created often sticks to the sides. the layers that get deposited on the sides and at the bottom of the vessel are scraped out. to this, semolina (rava), rose water and powdered sugar are added. later, it is garnished with dry fruits and a tint of saffron (kesar). khurchan is available in sweet and savoury forms.
