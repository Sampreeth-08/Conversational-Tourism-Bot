mughlai food
given that agra was once the capital of the mughal empire, it is no wonder that mughlai food can be found all over the city. kebabs, naans (leavened flatbread) and tikkas (cutlet or piece of meat) are found in its budget eateries as well as expensive restaurants. some of the more popular dishes include the sherbat, which is a sweet fruit-flavoured drink much loved by emperor shah jahan, and murgh musallam, which is a masala-coated chicken cooked whole and stuffed with a spicy mixture of minced meat.
