baati chokha
varanasi is famous for its baati chokha - a traditional meal popular all across uttar pradesh and bihar. balls of unleavened bread stuffed with dal (lentils), onions, peas or sattu (powdered roasted gram), are baked on wood fires and eaten withÂ  chokha (traditionally made with potato, tomato and roasted aubergine).
it is said that since baati was such a simple dish many freedom fighters like tantia tope and rani laxmi bai made it their travel meal. it hardly needed any water and could be baked without a utensil. moreover, it was packed with nutrients like carbohydrates, calcium, proteins and vitamins.
