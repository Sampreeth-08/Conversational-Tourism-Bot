velliyangiri andavar temple
located in the velliyangiri hills, this temple is dedicated to five forms of lord shiva. this unique temple houses all the lingams, representing the forms, in one place. this makes it a spiritually significant spot, inviting thousands of devotees every year, who trek up to the shrine. from here, devotees can get picturesque views of the surrounding areas and of the velliyangiri hills, which look like a peacock from some vantage points. the sanctum sanctorum of the temple houses the main shrine with two rock sculptures on either side, which are called dwarakapalakas.
