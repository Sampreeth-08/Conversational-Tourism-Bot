wooden crafts
thanks to a rich forest cover, jharkhand has an abundance of wood, which is used by people of various tribal groups to make household articles. some of the exquisite items tourists can buy include wall hangings, key hangers, fruit baskets, utensils, candle stands, flower vases, pen stands and toys. the locals also use wood to make windows, doors, boxes and wooden spoons. the intricately carved designs and patterns of the articles represent the rich tribal heritage of jharkhand that makes them a great choice for home decor. the tribal communities have a great respect for trees, which is why they use only the branches to create artefacts rather than cutting down the entire tree.
