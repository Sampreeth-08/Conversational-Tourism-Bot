palm leaf articles
originating from the town of nagore, near thanjavur, this craft uses several parts of palm trees to create daily life objects that are not only beautiful but also environment-friendly. palm leaves and fibres are braided together in varied patterns and are then used to weave baskets, boxes, trays, coasters, laundry baskets, suitcases, mats, boxes, hand fans, vases, glass holders etc. the mats are sometimes made from the stem of date palms. tender palm leaves are dried in the sun and their ribs are removed for the process. all the products use anything between 37 to 56 blades each. the blades are also held together with a copper wire for strength. once the product is made, it is painted with motifs to make it look more attractive. the bright colours and localised patterns are extremely popular with tourists.
