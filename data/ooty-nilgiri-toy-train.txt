nilgiri toy train
the nilgiri rail line was first started in 1899 from mettupalayam to coonoor and eventually expanded to udhagamandalam (old name of ootacamund) in 1908. the toy train on this line takes passengers from a height of 1,069 ft to 7,228 ft. this rail network is one of the steepest in asia. the line covers a total distance of 48 km in five hours from mettupalayam to ootacamund, covering kellar, coonoor, wellington and lovedale on the way. the route is extremely scenic and breathtaking. the view is particularly picturesque owing to the surrounding rocky terrain, ravines and lush green hills that one passes by.
