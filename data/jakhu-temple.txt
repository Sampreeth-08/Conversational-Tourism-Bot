shimla 
jakhu-temple 
perched atop the jakhu hill, the jakhu temple is a popular tourist site. dedicated to lord hanuman, it houses a 108-foot-tall idol of the deity. due to its location on the highest point of shimla, it offers sweeping views of the shivalik ranges. legend has it that lord hanuman stopped here in his quest for the sanjeevani plant, which was the herb needed to cure lord lakshmana as he was injured in the battle against ravana. another story suggests that one of lord hanuman's sandals fell at this spot, and thus a temple came to be built here. the temple lies about 2.5 km away from the famed ridge in shimla. it takes on a celestial charm during monsoons.
