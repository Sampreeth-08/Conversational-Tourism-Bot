panipat 
devi-temple 
devi temple is among the most significant spiritual sites in panipat. dedicated to goddess durga, the temple draws a large number of devotees from all parts of the country. the beautifully rebuilt devi temple stands as a fine specimen of indian temple architecture and invites huge crowds during durga puja when a special prayer service is held. according to legend, when the temple was being constructed, the idol of goddess durga was moved from one place to another but the idol shifted back to its original place the next morning after which it was decided that the temple will be built at the exact place where the idol was found. 
 
the temple is located on the banks of a large drought pond, which has now been converted into a children's park. the same park has also been hosting ramlila performances during navratri (a holy nine-day festival) for the last 100 years.
