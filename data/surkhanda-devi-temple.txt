mussoorie 
surkhanda-devi-temple 
located about 8 km from kanatal, at a height of almost 10,000 ft, surkhanda devi temple is one of the most popular tourist attractions in mussoorie. it is one of the 51 shaktipeethas (devotional shrines where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell) in the country. as per legend, goddess sati immolated herself in her father's yagya fire, when he insulted her husband lord shiva by not inviting him to the yagya. bereaved and enraged, shiva carried the body of sati and performed tandav (a dance of cosmic destruction). to stop him from annihilating the entire universe, lord vishnu severed the body of sati in 51 parts with his chakra. some body parts of sati are believed to have fallen at this spot and thus it is considered as a shaktipeetha. 
owing to its architectural excellence and spiritual prominence, the temple invites devotees and tourists alike. every year in the months of may and june, ganga dussehra festival is celebrated with much enthusiasm.
