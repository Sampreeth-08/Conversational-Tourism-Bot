ratnagiri
description
with a roaring sea lapping at its beautiful seashores and silver beaches, a thick cover of mangroves and verdant valleys blanketing most of its landscape, the port city of ratnagiri is like a gem that has dropped from nature's crown. punctuated with majestic valleys, massive creeks and marshlands, the unadulterated gorgeous beauty of ratnagiri, lying in maharashtra's konkan region, would turn any city its size green with envy.
during the months of february to april, the city plays host to the olive ridley turtles, who come at the beautiful velas beach to lay their eggs. the sight of a thousand baby turtles scampering to the safety of the sea for their first journey is an experience not easily forgotten.
surrounded by the spectacular sahyadri mountain range, ratnagiri is also blessed with a multitude of waterfalls and a rich flora and fauna. from recreational and sacred to historical and adventurous experiences, it offers everything that a traveller wishes for. its scenic beauty, age-old forts, picturesque beaches and bustling fishermen hamlets make it an amazing destination for travellers looking for a peaceful and quaint experience. the city is also called as the land of alphonso â€“ the king of mangoes, for the ripe varieties that grow here.
