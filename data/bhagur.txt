nashik 
bhagur 
bhagur is a scenic town replete with lush, rolling hills and pleasant weather, all of which make it a great weekend getaway from nashik. an hour-long drive promises splendid views of the hill range, as well as the verdant valleys laid out below. while you are in town, make some time for bhagur devi temple, which attracts a large number of devotees. this small yet beautiful temple is a must-see for those who love offbeat attractions, and is a great way to get acquainted with warm locals and purohits of bhagur. seek blessings of the goddess as you explore the premises of the temple, or sit in the courtyard and grab a moment of peaceful meditation. 
 
bhagur finds some significance in the indian freedom movement as it was the birthplace of the great freedom fighter veer savarkar.
