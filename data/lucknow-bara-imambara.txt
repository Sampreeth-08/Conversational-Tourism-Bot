bara imambara
bara imambara is perhaps the most recognisable and popular symbol of lucknow, and is visited by thousands of tourists all year round.
built as a relief project to provide work to the people of awadh during a famine, the bara imambara was constructed by nawab asaf-ud-daula during the 18th century, and its name essentially translates to a big place of worship. its architecture, with delicate arches and jharokhas (windows), boasts rajput, mughal and gothic influences.
