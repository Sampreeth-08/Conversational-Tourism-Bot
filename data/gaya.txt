gaya
description
steeped in spirituality and tranquillity, gaya, in bihar, is poised along the banks of the sacred falgu river. it is a prominent hindu pilgrim city, where tourists can trace the footsteps of lord rama. gaya holds the famous vishnupad temple as its crowning glory, with a number of other spiritual sites scattered around the region. most of these spiritual sites are rooted deep in legends and in stories of the epic ramayana. it is popularly believed that lord rama offered 'pinda-daan' (offerings made to ancestors for ensuring they have peace) at the famous ramshila hill and thus many pilgrims come from far to do the same. another must-see site is the akshay vat, which is believed to be the oldest standing tree on earth!
located 100 km from the state capital patna, gaya is surrounded by hills named mangala-gauri, shringa-sthan, ram-shila and brahmayoni. once a part of the magadh empire (684-320 bc), the cityâ€™s nomenclature is after a myth of demon gayasur, who was killed by lord vishnu. gaya is also important for the followers of jainism due to the presence of a large number of jain temples here.
