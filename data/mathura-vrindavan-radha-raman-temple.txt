mathura-vrindavan
spiritual
radha raman temple
it was established by gopal bhatta goswami, one of the six goswamis of vrindavan, who followed the principles of sri chaitanya mahaprabhu. the deity in the temple is said to have self-manifested from shaligrama shilas with a smile on face.
history suggests that gopal bhatta goswami bathed in the waters of river kali gandhaki, and found 12 shaligrama shilas. he brought them back to vrindavan and covered them with a cloth, before proceeding to take a short rest. when he uncovered the shilas the next day, he saw lord krishna among them, playing the flute. this meant that one of the shilas had transformed into the lord, as only 11 shaligrama shilas, instead of the original 12, were found.
