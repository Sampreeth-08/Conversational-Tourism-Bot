dungeshwari-temple 
also, known as mahakala caves, the dungeshwari caves are located 12 km north-east of bodh gaya. lord buddha is believed to have meditated in this place for six years before he went to bodh gaya to achieve enlightenment. a golden emaciated buddha sculpture commemorating his rigid penance is enshrined in one of the cave temples. another cave houses a large statue of lord buddha, about 6 ft high, to pay tribute to that phase of buddha's life. 
 
there is a popular myth associated with these cave temples and it is said that during his self-mortification, gautama became emaciated. a cow-herder by the name of sujata was moved by his weak appearance and offered him food and water. later, gautama realised that enlightenment cannot be attained by self-abasement and carried on with his journey to bodh gaya. one of the cave temples is dedicated to the hindu goddess, dungeshwari.
