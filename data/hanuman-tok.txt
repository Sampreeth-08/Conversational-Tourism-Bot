gangtok 
hanuman-tok 
a famous temple in the vicinity of the city, hanuman tok is dedicated to the worship of lord hanuman. about 11 km away from gangtok on the road to nathu la pass, the temple is at an elevation of 2,195 m. the hilltop is calm and serene, not to mention one of the best places to enjoy moments of relaxation away from the bustle of the city. it is also an architectural attraction for the circular structure of the temple, a one-of-its-kind in sikkim. 
according to a local legend, this is where lord hanuman stopped to rest while flying with the sanjeevani herb to lanka, to save lord rama’s brother, lakshmana. 
apart from a beautiful vista of mt khangchendzonga (kanchenjunga), the temple allows you to see selep water works—one of gangtok's primary sources of drinking water. 
lying adjacent to the temple is lukshyama, which is the cremation ground for the erstwhile royal family of sikkim, the namgyals. the stupas and chortens built here are a sight to behold. there is a saibaba temple close by that you can visit. hanuman tok has been maintained by a unit of the indian army since 1968. the best time to visit is between the months of march and june, when the weather is not too cold, and an undulating view of surrounding hills and valleys is possible.
