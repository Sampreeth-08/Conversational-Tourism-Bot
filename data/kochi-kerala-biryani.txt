popularly called malabar biryani, it is an aromatic layered rice dish that is made with chicken, fried onions, dry fruits, nuts and ghee (clarified butter). the ingredients are mixed together and then sealed and slowly cooked in steam, which is called the dum method. there is a plethora of recipes for this decadent dish, with each state and region having their own versions. the malabar style uses ghee and spices like cloves, cardamon, cinnamon and nutmeg liberally to give the dish a nice fragrance. moreover, unlike traditional biryani, this particular style uses a short and thin type of rice called khaima or jeerakasala.
