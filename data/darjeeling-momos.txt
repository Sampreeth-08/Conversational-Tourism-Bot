momos
momos are probably the most popular snack in darjeeling. these delicious dumplings are usually made with flour dough and stuffed with either meat or vegetables and can be steamed or fried. the non-vegetarian momos have either chicken or pork as stuffing while the vegetarian ones have cabbage, cheese and other vegetables. momos are served with a clear soup and sometimes achaar (pickles).
the history of the momo can be traced back to newar community, who used to travel to tibet often for trade. they learnt of these quirky dumplings and brought them back to india. while they're still most popular in the northeast, momos have now made their way to the rest of the country, with momo sellers setting up stalls and, in some cases, even large franchises based on this humble yet utterly delicious food.
