bibi ka maqbara
this is the burial place of mughal emperor aurangzeb’s wife, dilras banu begum (popularly known as bibi). she was given the title of rabia-ud-durrani, or the modern day rabia. the title refers to the memory of rabia basra, who was an iraqi aristocratic woman, well known for her generosity and kind-heartedness.
situated about 3 km from the city, the maqbara was built by aurangzeb’s son, azam shah, in 1678. made in the memory of his mother, the monument is very similar in design to the iconic taj mahal, and is popularly known as the taj of the deccan. it is one of the few grandiose mughal monuments in the deccan because of aurangzeb’s long-term association, as the governor, with the region. the mausoleum is flanked by spacious mughal gardens with axial ponds, fountains, water channels, broad pathways and pavilions. the gardens at bibi ka maqbara are designed in the char-bagh pattern, the signature style of most mughal gardens. these are gardens with a four-fold plot that have a large enclosure with essentially four geometric gardens in it. the monument has four minarets, about 72 ft high, and the raised plinth is surrounded by an octagonal lattice-screen of white marble.  the tomb itself is surrounded by octagonal screens of marble lattice work. there are a lot of marble plates and screens that adorn the mausoleum and have repeated patterns of lotus medallions, rosettes and floral patterns.
