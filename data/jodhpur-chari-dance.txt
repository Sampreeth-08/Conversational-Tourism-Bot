chari dance
the chari dance is representative of an activity that is an integral and essential part of the lives of rajasthani womenÂ  covering long distances to collect water in small pots, and walking back to the village with said pots balanced on their heads.
during the dance, performers don colourful outfits accented with heavy silver jewellery, and sway to the beats of melodious folk songs with a chari, or pot, balanced on their heads. traditional artists take it a step further, balancing brass pots (chari) with a burning lamp inside, on top of their heads.
