screen print
a beautiful art, screen printing is the method of forcing ink or paint into a fine surface cloth to make decorative patterns. it can be practiced on a diverse range of surfaces. screen printing made its big entry into the world of art in the 1960s. the technique, in essence, uses a mould that is prepared on a metal frame and is used for screen printing. after the cloth is secured from all sides, photosensitive chemicals are applied to it to get desired results. the process is traditionally known as serigraphy. earlier, silk was used for this kind of printing but now there is heavy usage of synthetic threads. a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate (underlying layer of the cloth). there are areas though that are made impermeable by the use of a blocking stencil. a blade is then moved across the screen to fill the open mesh with ink and reverse stroke causes the screen to touch the substrate. the colour is printed after several repetitions of the process; one can also print multicoloured images in this way.
