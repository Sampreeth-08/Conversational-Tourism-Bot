naina-devi 
this is one of the 51 shaktipeethas (where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell) associated with the cult of goddess durga. it is believed that this is the location where the eyes of goddess sati fell and that is why the temple is called naina (literally meaning eyes) devi. there is also a peepal tree within the premises that is considered to be as sacred as the temple. it is believed that the actual ancient temple was built in the 15th century under the rule of the kushan empire. located 100 km away from chandigarh, it attracts thousands of devotees every year. the temple is perched at a height of 11,000 m in the shivalik range. a large number of pilgrims  visit the temple during the nine day festival called navratri as well during the season of monsoon.  from the temple, a wonderful view of the gobind sagar lake can be availed. this lake lends a sense of serenity and natural sublimity to the backdrop of the temple. the scenic beauty of its location also makes it a must-visit.
