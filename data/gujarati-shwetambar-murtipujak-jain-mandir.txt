gujarati-shwetambar-murtipujak-jain-mandir 
the gujarati shwetambar murtipujak jain mandir is credited with being one of the first jain temples in south india. home to three beautifully carved gopurams (gateways) and five doors, the temple built completely in marble is a fine example of glass work.  the structure differs in construction from other buildings as the use of iron has been totally avoided in the temple. the idol that sits inside the premises is made of quartz.  in the central hall, one can see extensive glass work due to which the hall glows with a spectrum of colours.  it is believed that the architects, the stone carvers and the workers who were involved in the construction of the temple were hired from rajasthan.  the deity worshipped in the temple is lord parsvanatha, the 23rd tirthankara (saint) of the jains.
