sangam 
believed to be one of the holiest spots in the country, triveni sangam is the confluence of three sacred rivers - ganga, yamuna and the mystical saraswati. every 12 years, it turns into a venue for the kumbh mela, one of the largest human congregations in the world. as per popular belief, taking a dip in the holy water of the sangam absolves one of their sins. the water of the sangam provides a charming sight and you can easily discern the green waters of yamuna from the mineral and mud-carrying waters of the ganges. take a boat ride and soak in the peace and spirituality of the surrounding areas. one can also hire boats from qila ghat to the actual location where the two rivers converge.
