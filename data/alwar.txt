alwar
description
visiting alwar feels like stepping back in time. from a grand fort and palaces to a wildlife sanctuary that was the erstwhile royal hunting grounds, the city, nestled in the aravalli range, boasts myriad historical gems from the time when it was one of the oldest and the richest kingdoms in rajasthan.
the gigantic bala qila that looks nothing less than a grand monument is the centrepiece of the city. boasting six magnificent gates and a beautiful architecture, the fort is a great vantage point to get sweeping views of the city. the sariska wildlife sanctuary, which was the hunting reserve of the erstwhile maharaja, is another attraction. sheltering a sizeable population of tigers, chital, nilgai, sambar etc., the sanctuary also hosts ruins of ancient forts and temples that feature khajuraho-like carvings.
one can find a mention of alwar in the epic mahabharata, in which it is believed to be the place where the pandava brothers spent a part of their exile. it is said that alwar formed a part of the matsya territories of viratnagar in 1500 bc. moreover, the region was of prime importance during the mughal period as it served as a base to launch attacks on neghbouring kingdoms. it was later conquered by the jat ruler of bharatpur. however, pratap singh of machheri annexed it from the jats in 1775 and established it as a separate state.
