badla work
badla is the primary component of the famous zardozi needlework. in badla work, slabs of metal are melted and pierced through steel sheets. they are then drawn into wires and beaten into a fine shape. the unadorned wire is called badla. along with kasav (thread), sitara (spangles) and mukaish (small dots made of metal), badla work produces incredibly lovely fabrics that can be used for any occasion. it is quite popular in rajasthan, and has made its way to other parts of north india.
