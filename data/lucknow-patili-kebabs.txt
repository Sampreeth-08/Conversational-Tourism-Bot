patili kebabs
this unique version of kebabs is spicy and cooked on slow fire. the dum style of cooking adds to the taste. unlike other kebabs, patili kebabs are neither barbecued nor fried. they are cooled in a round-shaped brass or copper utensil called 'patili' from which the dish draws its name. these kebabs are served as a whole portion and not in pieces. when cooked in a patili, they become super soft and retain the flavour of all spices and other ingredients. they are generally eaten as a snack or appetiser, but when paired with rumali roti, turn into a filling meal.
