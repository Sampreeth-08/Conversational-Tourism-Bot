sapt-rishi-ashram-and-sapt-sarovar 
sapt sarovar is the spot where river ganga splits into seven different streams. legend has it that seven sages, kashyap, vashist, atri, vishwamitra, jamadagni, bhardwaj and gautam were once meditating here. and in order to avoid disturbing their prayers, the holy river separated itself into different streams and flowed on. today, an ashram, called the sapt rishi ashram, stands at this place, about 5 km from haridwar. the ashram acts as a retreat for many sages and saints who come here to meditate in the peaceful surroundings. it was established by goswami guru dutt in 1943. there are several rooms available for accommodation for those who want to stay over and have a more immersive experience. the spot is both spiritual and serene and ideal for meditation.
