jhansi
description
nestled between the betwa and pahunj rivers, the historic city of jhansi is synonymous with its courageous queen, rani lakshmibai, who valiantly fought against the british forces during the first war of indian independence in 1857. the lore and stories of the heroic queen, who was just 22 years old then, echo through the jhansi fort and the rani mahal, which are the most popular attractions. a fascinating sound and light show at the fort encaptures the gist of the life of the queen in an eloquent rendition and is a must-watch if you're stopping by.
the city is strewn with various spiritual sites and lakes that were commissioned under the patronage of the mighty dynasties that held the throne of jhansi at different points in time. their beauty and splendour speak of the glories of the day gone by, and tourists can find a treasure trove of history while visiting them.
jhansi was known as balwant nagar when it was the stronghold of the chandela kings, who ruled from the 9th to the 13rd century. around the 11th century, the city lost importance but in the 17th century, it rose back to prominence during the rule of raja bir singh deo of orchha, who constructed the jhansi fort on top of a rocky hill. the city became the capital of maratha province in the 18th century and later the princely state of jhansi between 1804 and 1853.
