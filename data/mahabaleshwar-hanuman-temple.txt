hanuman temple
this temple is home to a rare statue of lord hanuman where he has his right hand raised in a slapping gesture. there is no mace (gada) or the mountain of dronagiri in either of his hands. and unlike other temples where only the side of lord hanuman’s face can be seen, here one can witness his full frontal profile. shivaji’s guru, ramdas swami, is credited with having this temple made here.
