champaner pavagadh archaeological park
the unesco world heritage site of champaner-pavagadh archaeological park is marked by bastions and forts that begin from the pavagadh hills and extend into champaner city. to get a peek into history, walk around this splendid site that is a well-preserved islamic pre-mughal city. with a large number of hindu and jain temples as well as mosques, most of which were constructed during the time of the gujarat sultanate, the city has a lot to boast. from step wells, cemeteries, granaries and fortification walls, it is clearly evident that a well-planned town once existed here. at the base of the hill was located the principal township, which included the royal palace (hissar-i-khas) and the jama masjid that was strategically planned in the centre with arterial roads reaching the nine gates of the city. mosques were constructed near most of these gates at an elevation so that they were easily visible from a distance.
