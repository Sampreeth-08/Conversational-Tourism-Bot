hundru falls
the surreal hundru falls is formed when the gushing swarnarekha river plunges down a height of 320 ft and gathers into a frothy pool at the base. tourists can take a cooling dip in this pool and picnic on its side. the falls also makes for a great trekking spot and tourists need to climb as high as 750 steps to reach it.
