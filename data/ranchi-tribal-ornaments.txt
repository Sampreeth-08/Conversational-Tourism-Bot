tribal ornaments
the tribal communities of jharkhand are known for their eclectic jewellery, which is mostly made from materials like beads, precious stones, bell-metal and brass. some of the most attractive ornaments worn by tribal communities include necklaces, earrings, anklets, bracelets and bangles.
women also sport a kardhani on their waist and tikuli on their foreheads. the women of the santhal tribe wear earrings featuring striking motifs. some of these ornaments are made of wild grass. the silver ornaments copy the kundan work while the earrings are fragile in appearance. most of the tribal jewellery articles have motifs of berries, leaves and flowers.
