pragbodhi
around 7 km from bodh gaya, on a hill, is located pragbodhi (meaning prior to enlightenment). it is believed that lord buddha spent seven years living an austere life in a cave in this hill before he attained enlightenment. his belief during his stay was that one can find the truth through asceticism. however, sometime later he realised he was wrong. now known as dungeshwari cave, it has a small temple at the spot where lord buddha meditated. a short hike to the top of the hill offers stunning views of the land around and the ruins of a few stupas. one can also catch sight of the mahabodhi temple from here. pragbodhi is generally a three-four hour trip from bodh gaya.
