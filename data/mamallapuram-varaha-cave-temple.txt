varaha cave temple
the varaha cave temple is known for four exquisite carvings of lord vishnu, goddess gajalakshmi, lord trivikama (the fifth avatar of lord vishnu) and goddess durga. this hilltop temple has exquisite rock-cut formations that are a fine example of the sculpting work done by vishwakarmas of that century. the most prominent sculpture is of lord vishnu's incarnation as a varaha (boar), who is lifting bhudevi (mother earth) out of the ocean to rescue her. several other mythical characters have been etched on the walls of this cave temple, along with ornate images of majestically seated lions. the outward-facing panels are graced by goddesses lakshmi and durga. on the right-hand panel, upon entering the cave, one can see lord vishnu on an eight-armed giant form, called trivikarma, in the act of killing the demon mahabali. dating back to the 7th century, this temple is also known as the adhivaraha cave temple.
