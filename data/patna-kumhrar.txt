kumhrar
located on the outskirts of patna, kumhrar is the site where the archaeological remains of the ancient city of pataliputra were found. the most striking ruin found is that of an 80-pillared hall made of sandstone, dating back to around 300 bc (the mauryan period), which is said to be the location of the third buddhist council.
pataliputra was ruled by great kings like ajatasatru (491–459 bc), chandragupta (321–297 bc) and ashoka (274–237 bc). excavations have proven that this magnificent city flourished between 600 bc and 600 ad. for about 1,000 years pataliputra served as the capital of several great indian dynasties like saisunaga, nanda, maurya, sunga and gupta. it was also one of the most important centres of education, art and culture, commerce and religion. the first prominent account of pataliputra is found in indica, a book authored in 300 bc by megasthenese, the greek ambassador at the court of chandragupta maurya, who mentions the city as palibothra. according to megasthenese, the city was shaped like a parallelogram, spreading about 14 km east-west along the ganges. its circumference was about 36 km. the city was protected by gigantic wooden stake-walls and a broad and deep moat. remnants of the wooden stake-wall have been excavated at several locations in patna, including lohanipur, bahadurpur, sandalpur, bulandibagh and kumhrar.
