appam with stew
this dish has been prevailing on the food scene in kerala for a long time. pancakes made of fermented rice batter and coconut are cooked as appam. these have a soft and thick centre and a paper-thin crust, thus they must be eaten very delicately. the stew served with this will leave you wanting more. it has succulent chunks of chicken bathed in creamy coconut gravy, along with vegetables, green chillies, garlic, ginger and local spices.
