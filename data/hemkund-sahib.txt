hemkund-sahib 
hemkund sahib, formally known as gurudwara sri hemkund sahib is a highly-revered pilgrimage site for the sikh community. it is believed that guru gobind singh ji, the tenth guru of the sikhs, spent 10 years in meditation here. what adds to the popularity of the religious site is its stunning location surrounded by the garhwal himalayas. hemkund sahib is nestled between the peaks of the hemkund parvat. the name 'hemkund' means lake of snow and the waters are actually ice cold. the gurudwara is visited by a large number of devotees from all corners of the country before it closes down for the winter season between october and april. sikh pilgrims arrive at the gurudwara to help repair the trail which is often left damaged after the winter season. the gurudwara also houses a scenic lake where devotees take a holy dip. it is believed that the place once used to be a meditation ground for lord rama's brother, lakshmana. a nearby temple dedicated to lord lakshmana can also be visited during a trip to hemkund sahib.
