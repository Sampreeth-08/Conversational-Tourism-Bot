bedsa caves
around 45 km away from pune, in the maval taluka lie bedsa caves that were excavated in the 1st century bc. with two finished and two unfinished buddhist caves, bedsa is surely worth a visit, and can be accessed through a series of steps on a slope. you will also come across a few rock-cut cisterns and a memorial stupa, the highlight of the caves. some striking carvings can be seen at the chaityagriha that has a stone screen, as well as a verandah with engraved pillars, which are 25-foot-tall and support a ribbed roof. figures of couples riding horses and elephants have been intricately carved into these pillars, thus giving the impression of being sculptures themselves. the roof is also supported by orthogonal pillars.
