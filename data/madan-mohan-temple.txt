madan-mohan-temple 
one of the oldest temples of its ilk, the madam mohan temple is perched atop the dwakshadwitiya hill. legend has it, lord krishna rested here after defeating the kaliya nag that emerged from the waters of the yamuna. drenched and cold, the lord lay shivering, until the 12 suns, or dwaksha aditya, rose to give him warmth. the word 'madan' is a nod to kamadeva, the lord of desire and love, while 'mohan' means the one who charms. together the name is in deference to the god who can even charm the lord of love. 
the original temple tower is flanked by buildings made of red sandstone on either side that are together representative of mughal architectural sensibilities. the building to the left remains closed, while the one to the right has a bhajan kutir (cottage) and samadhi (cenotaph) of sri sanatana goswami, a disciple of chaitanya mahaprabhu. the central building holds the idols of goddess radha and lord krishna, along with lalita, one of the sakhis or friends of radha. 
while at the temple, you can visit the krishna kupa, a well said to have been created by lord krishna for his devotees, and the advaita vat, an old banyan tree, where sri advaita acharya rested and chanted the holy names of lord krishna. 
the temple was built in 1580 by kapur ram das (a trader of multan) under the guidance of sri sanatana goswami.
