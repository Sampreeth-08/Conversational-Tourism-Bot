kantilo 
on the banks of river mahanadi lies kantilo, a town about 100 km from bhubaneswar. it is noted for being the home of a temple dedicated to lord nilamadhaba. the structure lies atop the twin hills of brahmadri (this hill is well-known for offering a beautiful view of the sunset from the top) and niladri and is surrounded by a forest. it is revered by those who worship lord jagannath and the presiding deity of the temple is believed to be an earlier form of lord jagannath of puri. in the cult of lord jagannath, lord nilamadhaba is said to occupy a key position. in fact, in the jagannath puri temple, lord nilamadhaba's shrine is present on the right side of the lakshmi temple. since it's a miniature version of puri's sri jagannath temple, it follows the same rites and rituals. it is believed that a perennial flow of holy water emanates from the feet of lord nilamadhaba. the temple sees a large footfall during the celebrations of maghasaptamiÂ  bhaimaekadashi, in the month of magha here. 
moreover, kantilo is a popular picnic spot, which is also famed for brass and bell metal crafts, including utensils. they make for great souvenirs to take back home.
