sahastraling talav
also known as sahastra linga tank or sahasra linga talav, this man-made tank has been built on the durlabh sarovar (lake). constructed in the medieval times, it was commissioned by the solanki or chaulukya dynasty. the tank is among the biggest waterfront constructions made during the solanki period in 1084. it is a fine example of engineering of that time, and one would be left in awe of the processÂ  by which water was taken from river saraswati. one can see how the channels were cleverly carved into stone inlets, to allow the water to collect and then flow into the tank. the sahastra king, talav, is also said to have inbuilt natural filtration to clean the water!
the reservoir looks like a work of art as intricate carvings of deities grace its walls and columns. the monument is protected by the archaeological survey of india (asi) today.
