kari dosai
this thick and almost pizza-like creation is favoured by visitors and locals alike and packs quite a punch. the base is a layer of egg, the centre a thick and hearty dosa and all that goodness is topped off with a hefty serving of finely minced mutton, which is spiced and seasoned to perfection. the recipe is credited to the konar community, of whom the majority are cow and goat herds.
