kalakshetra
in 1936, the kalakshetra foundation was established by rukmini devi arundale. the aim of this organisation can be summed up in her own words: “with the sole purpose of resuscitating in modern india, recognition of the priceless artistic traditions of our country and of imparting to the young the true spirit of art, devoid of vulgarity and commercialism." several notable and famous bharatanatyam performers have learnt the art form here.  the place is a testimony of rukmini devi's dreams. she wanted to create a space where the indian thought would find expression through artistic education. the institution is spread over 100 acre by the seashore. it is an important centre for the study and performance of fine arts. the government of india recognised the institute as an institute of national importance by an act of indian parliament in the year 1993 and it is now an autonomous body under ministry of culture, government of india. here, the students are taught dancing and are educated to become more that just an artiste. their training includes learning the right attitude to life and art. across the road, one can also visit the kalakshetra craft centre. one gets a chance to see kanchipuram-style of handloom weaving, block printing and the art of kalamkari. the centre also gives an opportunity to tourists to join various courses and learn them.
