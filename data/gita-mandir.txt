gita-mandir 
an amalgamation of marble and red sandstone, gita mandir is a marvellous example of architectural ingenuity, with exquisite paintings of gods and goddesses adorning its marble walls. the idols of lord krishna, goddess lakshmi, lord narayana, lord rama and goddess sita are all decorated with pretty ornaments. there is a pillar in the garden with shlokas from the holy bhagwat gita on it. dedicated to lord vishnu, this temple was built by jugal kishore birla, from the famed birla group, in memory of his parents. 
during the festival of krishna janmashtami, the temple is decked to the nines, and illuminated to shine like a star in the night sky. other festivals like holi are also celebrated with great enthusiasm at gita mandir, with devotees pouring in from all over the country to witness the grand pujas or holy ceremonies that take place during this time.
