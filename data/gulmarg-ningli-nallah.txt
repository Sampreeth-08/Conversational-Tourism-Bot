the beautiful mountain stream of ningle nallah flows 10 km from gulmarg, in the baramulla district of jammu and kashmir. it is flanked by snowy mountains and lush green pastures and looks quite picturesque. the main source of this stream is water formed by the melting of ice in alpather lake and apharwat peak. after winding its way through mountains and valleys, the stream joins the bigger river jhelum. tourists and locals visit this place for family picnics. visitors, who are fond of camping, can set up camps in the nearby meadow and stay the night.
this stream also serves as a water source for rural dwellers and its stony terrains enhance its visual appeal. its uneven lands and challenging slopes also invite trekkers to test their mettle.
