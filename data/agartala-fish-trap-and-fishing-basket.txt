fish trap and fishing basket
fish traps and fish baskets are crafts esteemed amongst the tribes of the state. sudha is basically a net that is a rectangular bamboo mat woven in an open-twill weave. it is suspended from crossed splints and held in both hands so that the front of the net is inclined towards the body and against the flow of water. fish that swim into the net are scooped up out of the water and stored in a basket. these baskets come in various shapes and sizes and may be of a conical or cylindrical type.
