sri-kamakshi-temple 
the name kamakshi refers to goddess saraswati (goddess of education) and goddess lakshmi (goddess of wealth), where 'ka' means saraswati, 'ma' means lakshmi and 'akshi' means eye. the imposing temple is dedicated to goddess kamakshi (considered as the ultimate form of goddess parvati). 
the deity of this temple is unique in that instead of the traditional standing position, her idol is in the yogic position of padmasana. she is seen holding a sugarcane bow and five flowers in the two of her lower arms, and a pasha (lasso), and an ankusha (goad) in her two upper arms. the goddess is flanked by the holy trinity (lord shiva, lord vishnu and lord brahma). 
here, an annual festival is held on the ninth lunar day in the months of february and march. during other festivals such as navratri and sankara jayanti, the temple is especially crowded, receiving hundreds of tourists every day. it is also one of the 51 shaktipeethas or devotional shrines where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell. 
the temple, spread over 5 acre, is open till 8:30 pm at night, and is lit up like a jewel after sundown, transforming into an alluring visual treat for devotees and photographers alike. four services are offered every day, starting with pujas in reverence of the elephants that live here.
