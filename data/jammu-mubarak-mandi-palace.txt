mubarak mandi palace
once a royal residence of dogra kings, mubarak mandi palace is one of the most attractive tourist sites in jammu. having a history of more than 150 years, the complex has numerous palaces, buildings and courtyards. it was a prime place of the kingdom until 1925, when raja hari singh shifted to hari niwas palace in jammu. gol ghar, a part of this building is now in a state of ruins but still retains its former grandeur. one can also visit the pink hall that has been transformed into a museum, housing miniature paintings and a gold-plated bow and arrow of mughal emperor, shah jahan. the architecture is captivating and a blend of rajasthani, mughal and european styles.
