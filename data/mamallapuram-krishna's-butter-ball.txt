krishna's butter ball
this immense boulder, about 16 ft high, is one of the prominent tourist sites in mamallapuram. defying gravity, the boulder is balanced precariously on a narrow base. it is symbolic of lord krishna's love for butter. according to legend, the boulder is a representation of the amount of butter that lord krishna used to steal and eat. an old wives' tale additionally tells that lots of kings under the pallava dynasty with their army and elephants tried to move the boulder but it would not budge an inch. the boulder has a breadth that almost matches its height, and though it is rounded at some angles, it is not a perfect sphere. today, it stands proudly as an attraction for all the visitors in mamallapuram and leaves people confused with its logic-defying balance.
