sujata garh
an ancient stupa, sujata garh is believed to be the place where lord buddha meditated, following severe penance of fasting before he attained enlightenment. as per legend, a lady called sujata, a cow-herder, offered buddha a bowl of rice when she saw him emaciated from all the meditating. buddha realised the futility of self-deprivation and accepted the lady's offer. thus, the place has been named sujata garh after the lady. it is believed that the meal not only gave buddha strength but also inspired him to follow the middle path. after this incident, buddha went to the bodhi tree under which he was enlightened. while visiting here, one can also head to sujata kuti, lying along the falgu river, which marks the house of sujata.
