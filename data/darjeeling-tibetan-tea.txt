tibetan tea
tibetan tea, known as po cha in tibet, is perhaps the most preferred beverage in the cold parts of india, especially the northeast and the himalayan regions.
this delicious and indulgent drink, make with long tea leaves that are kept in tea bags to preserve their fragrance and flavours, with a dollop of home-made butter mixed in, will help you keep the cold at bay. it is also salty rather than sugary, setting it apart from sweeter contemporaries. another version is the lemon tea made with ginger and honey.Â in tibetan custom, the tea when served to guests is topped up every time the guest takes a sip, thus ensuring that the cup never goes empty. while its origins can be traced as far back as the 7th century, it wasn't until the 13th century that it took its current form, at the time of phagmodu kings.
