paneer gulnar kebab
paneer gulnar kebab is the vegetarian version of meat kebab, with cottage cheese as the main ingredient. in the dish, paneer cakes are filled with khus, and marinated in a thick, flavourful beetroot paste. with a lovely pink hue, these kebabs are rich and creamy, and a particular favourite during weddings and other special occasions. garnished with pomegranate pearls, green chilli and fenugreek leaves, gulnar kebabs are a filling snack, which are sometimes served with chapathi (indian flatbread) or rice.
gulnar kebabs are said to have originated in persia, and then spread to asian and middle eastern countries. it is said that to prepare the meat variant of the dish, soldiers would even use their swords to skewer small pieces of meat and grill them on an open fire.
