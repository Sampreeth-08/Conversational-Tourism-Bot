rudraprayag
rudraprayag is named after lord shiva (rudra) and is situated at the confluence of rivers alaknanda and mandakini. it lies at a distance of about 34 km from srinagar (garhwal) and 141 km from rishikesh. it is believed that this was the spot where to master the mysteries of music, narad muni worshipped lord shiva. it is said that shiva appeared in his rudra avatar to bless narad muni. rudraprayag holds significance as it has two prominent temples of hinduism--the jagdamaba temple and the shiva temple. the town of kedarnath, which holds great spiritual significance for devotees, is about 86 km from here.
