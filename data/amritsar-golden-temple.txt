golden temple
amritsar is world-famous for the beautiful and highly revered golden temple or sri harmandir sahib, which is one of the most prominent spiritual sites in the country. the temple is a two-storeyed structure with its top half covered in almost 400 kg of pure gold leaf, which is what earned it its english moniker. maharaja ranjit singh, the leader of the sikh empire, is believed to have initiated the construction in the 19th century. the rest of the temple complex is built in white marble, inlaid with precious and semi-precious colourful stones. to create motifs, the pietra dura technique has been used. the grand temple complex is awe-inspiring in its size.
one must cover oneâ€™s head and remove his/her footwear before entering the golden temple, as a mark of respect. as one listens to the beautiful notes of gurbani (spiritual songs), the serene spirituality of the temple soothes the soul. one can also partake of the free meal that is offered here to around 20,000 people every day at the guru ka langar (community meal), regardless of caste, creed or gender. the entire process is managed by volunteers and is one of the most humbling experiences you can have.
