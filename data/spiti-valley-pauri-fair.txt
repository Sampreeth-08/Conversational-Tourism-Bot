pauri fair
devotees flock here in the third week of august to be a part of this religious and festive fair. they start by paying obeisance to the triloknath (shiva, the lord of the three worlds) or avilokiteshvara, as he is regarded by the buddhists. this is followed by parikrama of the temple – circumambulations in the gallery three or seven times while murmuring the mantra “om mani padme hum” and rotating the prayer wheels.
this is done every morning and evening. ghee and mustard oil lamps, which have a capacity of up to 16 kg, are lit continuously. devotees donate money or ghee/oil to keep these lamps alight. after all these rituals, starts the fair that has stalls and tea shops. there is dancing to folk melodies in a huge circle. on the second morning is the procession headed by the thakur of triloknath, who rides on a decorated horse. it goes up to the place where, according to ancient tales, the seven gods had appeared from the seven springs eons ago. once the procession returns, the devotees either head home or stay on for the third day of the fair.
