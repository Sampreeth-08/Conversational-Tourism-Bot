stone carvings
stone carving is an ancient craft of tamil nadu and the temples of chennai are famous for their mesmerising stone carving structures. the stone carvers belong to the viswakarma community and are skilled in carving idols out of black and white granite, locally known as karappu kal and vellai kal. the first step for stone carving involves stencilling the granite stone by cutting it according to determined lines. once the final product is ready, its surface is cleaned and smoothened to give it a shiny lustre. it is then painted as per the needed design. the themes used in making most of the stone carving articles revolve around incidents from hindu mythological epics. some of the articles you can shop for include small dolls, animal figurines, incense stick stands and other decorative items.
