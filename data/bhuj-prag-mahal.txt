prag mahal
adding to the splendour of the aina mahal, the prag mahal lies right next to it. made of italian marble and sandstone, the palace has spacious halls and a 45-m-high bell tower, which is a major attraction for visitors. the clock tower in the palace, which is considered to be the second-highest tower of its kind in india, is another attraction. from the top of the tower, one can get sweeping and panoramic views of the city.
reflecting the royal grandeur of times gone by, there are a variety of classic statues and chandeliers in the grand durbar hall of the palace. prag mahal also houses a museum that exhibits remnants and personal collection of the royal family.
