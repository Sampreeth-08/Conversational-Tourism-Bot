Festival
fire walking festival
an exciting albeit dangerous fiesta is the fire walking festival. devotees, wearing saffron-coloured clothes, observe severe austerities and fast for a period of 40 days during the months of october or november. on the main night, after a purification bath, they walk barefoot across a 4-m-long pit of burning coal.
