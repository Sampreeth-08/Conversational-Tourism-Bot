srinagar
description
picturesque and enchanting, srinagar is cradled high in the lofty green himalayas and hailed all over the world for its incredible natural beauty. surrounded by mountain peaks, lush green valleys, glistening lakes, temples and spectacular mughal-era gardens, the city has inspired poets through centuries. the summer capital of jammu and kashmir, srinagar, is situated in the heart of the kashmir valley with the nagin and the dal lake adding to its beauty.
located at an altitude of 1,730 m, this ancient city is crisscrossed by chinar tree-lined roads and quaint wooden bridges; and is home to bustling bazaars, sufi shrines and forts. add to this, the charms of flavourful kashmiri cuisine and apples and walnuts from the lush orchards surrounding the city. kalhana, the author of rajatarangini, a historical chronicle of early india penned in 1148, has written that it was emperor ashoka (3rd century bc) who founded the city of srinagari, which may have been situated a little away from the current city of srinagar.
however, king pravarasena ii of the vakataka dynasty (400-415 bc) is credited as the founder of present-day srinagar. akbar was the first mughal emperor to capture the kashmir valley and he built some of the most well-planned gardens and mosques in srinagar. the city's beauty was enhanced during the reign of maharaja ranjit singh. in winter, srinagar takes on a white glow, covered in soft snow. and in summer, as the snow melts, and the flowers in the meadows bloom, the city resembles an artist's canvas.
