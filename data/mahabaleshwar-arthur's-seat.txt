arthur's seat
for a beautiful view of jor valley, this is the ideal viewing point. it is said that sir arthur mallet, who is said to be the first man to build a house here, used to sit and admire river savitri from this point. also known as the queen of the points, and originally as madhi mahal, arthur’s seat lies at an elevation of 1,470 m. the most appealing and entertaining feature of this place is the air pressure that causes light objects, like bottle caps, to float! the southern side of arthur’s seat has stratified rocks that are similar in appearance to the grand canyon in colorado, usa. echo point, hunter point, tiger spring point, window point and malcom point are some of the other viewing points here.
