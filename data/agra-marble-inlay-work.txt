marble inlay work
agra is famous for its marble inlay work, which is artwork done on marble. agra is more popularly known for the parchin kari work, which involves very precise and minute inlay work. this classical art form rose to fame during the mughal era, particularly after the construction of the taj mahal. it involves shaping small pieces of semi-precious stones in patterns of flower petals, leaves etc. these are then fitted together to look like a complete flower or animal. this art is believed to have been derived from a similar italian art form called pietra dura (hard stones), which started in florence in the 16th century. this was brought to the indian subcontinent by european travellers, who impressed emperor shah jahan with their exquisite craft. the taj mahal is the perfect specimen of parchin kari work. beautiful works can be seen on the cenotaphs of shah jahan and mumtaz mahal, where the same flower patterns have been repeated with exactly the same number of stones in each. this craft has been passed down generations for more than 350 years. the tomb of amir khusro, sufi musician and poet, also features some beautiful marble inlay work.
