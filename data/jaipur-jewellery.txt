jewellery
jaipur is a hotspot for kundan jewellery and has a history of jewellery with precious gems that can be traced back to more than two and a half centuries. apart from kundan, jaipur is known for the manufacture of specialised jewellery such as minakari and processing of coloured gems. moreover, it is a global centre of cut and polished emeralds. one can also shop for coloured gems, silver and pearls here. however, kundan remains the highlight of this royal city. historical sources say that the art of making kundan jewellery came to rajasthan from delhi. today kundan jewellery has become a choice accessory of brides. the process of making kundan jewellery is a fascinating one. it starts with a skeletal framework called ghaat. then, wax is poured onto the framework and moulded according to design. this process is called paadh. the next step is khudai where the uncut multi-coloured gemstone is laid on the framework that can be made of pure gold or other metals. this is followed by minakari, where refining is done to define the details of the design. then, gold foils are added that hold the gems to the framework and this step is called pakai. finally, the gems are polished in the chillai process.
