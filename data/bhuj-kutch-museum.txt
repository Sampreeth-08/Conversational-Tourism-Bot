set up in 1877 by maharao khengarji, the kutch museum is the oldest of its kind in gujarat, which was built to exhibit the wedding gifts of the king. built in the typical gothic style of architecture, it is a great place to trace the royal history of gujarat.
the museum houses 11 galleries, namely, picture gallery, anthropological section, archaeological section, textiles section, weapons section, music instruments section, shipping section and stuffed animals section. moreover, there are sections devoted to the tribal community that exhibit ancient artefacts, folk arts, crafts and information about tribal people, who are a major part of kutch's history and culture. it is famed for housing the largest collection of kshatrapa inscriptions that can be traced back to 1st century ad. the museum is also home to remnants of the kutchi script text, which is now extinct, along with a collection of coins that includes the 'kori', which was kutch's local currency. the museum also showcases exhibits relating to embroidery, paintings, arms, musical instruments, sculpture and precious metalwork. as you enter the two-storeyed building, you are greeted by an 18th century statue of 'airavata' (a mythological white elephant who carries the hindu god indra).
