safa-masjid 
located in ponda, the safa masjid was built in 1560 by ibrahim adil shah, the sultan of bijapur. it is a huge complex and amongst its ruins are various gardens and fountains that make for a tranquil setting. a pointed terracotta tile roof covers the main rectangular prayer hall of the mosque. the best time to visit here is during the festivities of id-ul-fitr and id-ul-zuha, when it is adorned with exquisite decorations. the most interesting aspect of the safa masjid complex is the huge water tank with 44 hammams or hot air baths that dot its four interior sides. the tank has a flight of steps made in typical hindu bathing style of ghats. both the tank as well as the mosque have been made in laterite stone masonry.
