rameswaram
description
nestled in pamban island that is shaped like a conch, rameswaram, in tamil nadu, is a quaint town that is connected to the indian mainland by the 2-km-long pamban bridge. drawing thousands of pilgrims every year, rameswaram is renowned for sri ramanathaswamy temple, dedicated to lord shiva. speckled with a number of other religious sites, this quiet town is an ideal spiritual retreat.
rameswaram is heavily associated with the stories of lord rama, who left the indian mainland to rescue his wife, goddess sita, from the clutches of ravana, who had taken her to sri lanka. a stone's throw from rameswaram lies dhanushkodi that has been endowed with magical natural beauty. flanked by the bay of bengal on one side and the indian ocean on the other, dhanushkodi is an explorer's delight.
