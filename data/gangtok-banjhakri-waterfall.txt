banjhakri waterfall
the banjhakri waterfall  plunges straight down with a loud, gushing noise, from a height of 40 ft. surrounded by  beautifully-trimmed gardens, which are spread over 2 acre of lush land, the waterfall is one of the most serene spots in the city. lying close to the ranka monastery, the waterfall is now part of an energy park, which generates unconventional sources of energy. all around, there are pavilions where one can stand and marvel at the sight of the falls. there are also foot bridges constructed in the sikkimese style of architecture so visitors can cross from one place to another. you can indulge in boating in a man-made lake here, which hosts a statue of a dragon at its center. there are also well laid-out trails, a cafe to satisfy hunger pangs and an information kiosk for those curious about the shaman culture. there is also a souvenir shop to splurge at.
a banjhakri, according to folk tales within the nepali community in sikkim, is a traditional healer, also translated as a jungle priest or magician. the first ban jhakri is said to have had the power to dispel evil spirits.
