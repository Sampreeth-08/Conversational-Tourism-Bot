lebong race course
situated on the outskirts of darjeeling, lebong race course was made in 1885 as a ground for parades. it is the smallest race course in the world with a complete lap measuring 480 yards. it is also one of the highest in the world situated at a height of 1,809 m above the sea level.
the valley of lebong is quite a lovely attraction all by itself. sitting pretty below the main town of darjeeling, it is visible from the top of the mall (city center), and makes for a stunning photo op. this is where the tea plantations first appeared in the area in the 1850s. today, the tea gardens of ging, badamtam, and phoobshering attract plenty of footfalls all year round.
