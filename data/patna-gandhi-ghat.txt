gandhi ghat
while there are several ghats (stepped banks of a river) on river ganges in patna, the gandhi ghat is the most popular. it is named after the great leader of the freedom struggle of india, mahatma gandhi, whose ashes are believed to have been immersed in ganga from this ghat. every weekend, the ghat comes alive as the evening arti (a ritual performed with lamps) of the river is conducted here. priests dressed in saffron robes, perform the arti, along with prayers and songs. the start of the arti is marked by the blowing of a conch shell.
visitors can also enjoy boat rides at the ghat. the bihar state tourism development corporation (bstdc) runs a river cruise ship, the mv ganga vihar, from here. watching the ritual of the arti unfold from the ship or any hired boat is a memorable experience.
