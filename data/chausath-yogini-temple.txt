'yogini' is a term that is used in buddhism as well as in hinduism and refers to a female practitioner of yoga who is also an enlightened guide or guru. the term is also associated with the sacred feminine force, who is considered to be an incarnation of goddess parvati. these incarnations are believed to have taken the form of eight matrikas or of 64 yoginis. there are a number of temples across the country, which are dedicated to this feminine principle, chausath yogini being one of them. 
 
yoginis are considered to be a part of a secret cult. they are thought to be so powerful that they can cause acute destruction through their powers if offended. this yogini temple is believed to have been built during the 10th century during the kalachuri reign.
