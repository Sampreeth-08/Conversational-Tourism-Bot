kebabs
even though kebabs are not particularly a south indian speciality, thanks to a few brilliant food joints in the city, they are a very popular dish here. while in ootacamund, head to any of the roadside kebab stalls or dhabas and indulge your palate with these oil-dipped yummies. tear into grilled, succulent chunks of chicken meat or lamb, or the equally fantastic soya and paneer kebabs. a butter naan (indian leavened flatbread drenched in butter) goes nicely with kebabs.
