gangtok 
do-drul-chorten 
the do-drul chorten was built by trulshi rimpoche, head of the nyingma order of tibetan buddhism, in 1946, and is close to the research institute of tibetology. before he came here, the place was said to have been haunted by evil spirits, and anyone who came here would fall prey to these diabolical entities and died. the stupa was constructed as a means of protection for the locals. 
its structure is marked by a golden dome, which is visible from various vantage points in gangtok. inside this stupa, there are complete mandala sets, a set of kan-gyur relics (holy books), zung (mantras) and other religious objects. the deity enshrined on top of the chorten stupa is known as dorjee phurpa or vajra kilaya. there are 108 mani-lhakor (prayer wheels) that are rotated clockwise while chanting ‘om mani padme hum’ to invoke the bodhisattva. 
the chorten is surrounded by smaller ones, like chorten lakhang and guru lakhang, where there are two huge statues of guru rimpoche (guru padmasambhava). another stupa, known as the jhang chup chorten, was built in memory of trulshi rimpoche, one of the teachers of the 14th dalai lama, after his death. after his passing, another famous lama by the name of dodhrubchen rinpoche established his teaching centre on the same premises. the chorten can accommodate 700 monks.
