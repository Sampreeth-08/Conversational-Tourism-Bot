hazrat nizamuddin dargah
one of the most prominent spiritual sites in delhi, hazrat nizamuddin dargah is the shrine of muslim sufi saint, nizam-ud-din auliya (1238 - 1325 ad). it is a beautiful structure comprising intricate jaalis (lattice screens) and a vast courtyard framed by marble arches. dating back to the 14th century, this dargah has been built in the islamic style of architecture. it is a square-shaped building with a dome-shaped roof. a particular attraction is a 13th century room, called hujra-e-qadeem, which makes for an interesting visit.
the dargah draws devotees from far and wide and they can be seen tying a red thread on the jaalis so their prayers can be answered. while performing the prayers, they also light incense sticks and shower rose petals. offering a chadar (a large sheet of fabric) at the shrine is considered especially auspicious. the best time to visit the dargah is on thursday, when qawwali performances are held in the evening. such is its renown that the dargah has been a cinematic backdrop for several movies like bajrangi bhaijaan (2015) and rockstar (2011).
