gangotri 
submerged-shivling 
this natural rock shivling that remains submerged under water is one of the most sacred spots in gangotri. it can be seen clearly during the winter season when the water level recedes. devotees visit this spot so as to worship at the place where it is said that lord shiva sat to receive ganga in his matted locks. legend has it that goddess ganga transformed herself into a river to dissolve the sins of mythological king bhagirathaâ€™s ancestors after he performed intense penance. since the flow of the river was mighty, lord shiva gathered it into his matted locks. the shivling is located in close proximity to the gangotri temple and is an amazing sight that reinforces one's belief in the divine.
