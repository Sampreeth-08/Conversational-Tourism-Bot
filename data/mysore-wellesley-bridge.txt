wellesley bridge
built in 1804 by dewan purnaiah, wellesley bridge was named after governor general marquis of wellesley. the bridge is located in the town of srirangapatna, which is about an hour and a half from mysore. it showcases native architecture, with stone pillars, stone corbels, and girders. while it looks quite rugged, it has been able to withstand the test of time, and even survived several floods. it is still standing strong, and makes for a lovely spot for a photography session. the jagged rock structure built across a lovely river, surrounded by lush green vistas on either side creates an exquisite portrait, one that the locals and tourists alike love to visit all year round. be sure to mark it on your itinerary while coming down here.
