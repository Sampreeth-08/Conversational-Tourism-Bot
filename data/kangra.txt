kangra
description
from one of the oldest forts in the country to exhilarating and challenging treks, small but charming kangra in himachal pradesh, carves a niche for itself among hill towns. nestled in the kangra valley, between the dhauladhar and shivalik ranges, kangra has an unparallelled beauty and artistic heritage that are punctuated by its opulent temples and bustling bazaars. the exquisite kangra paintings, renowned all over the world for their brilliant colours and intricate decorative detail, are like a cherry on the top for art-lovers.
the city is also home to a shaktipeeth (devotional shrine where the body parts of goddess shakti fell), the brijeshwari temple that sees a large number of footfalls throughout the year. the kangra fort, which has been a centre point of thousand years of grandeur, invasion and war in the region, is among the prime attractions here.
a short distance from dharamsala, a hub of trekking, kangra remains one of the most sought-after destinations in himachal pradesh.
