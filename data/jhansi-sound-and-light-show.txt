things-to-do
sound and light show
the sound and light show is an eloquent rendition of the great escape of the brave rani lakshmibai, who is said to have tied her son to her back, jumped on a horse and galloped to safety, when the sprawling jhansi fort fell into the hands of the british. picking scenes and drawing inspirations from various acts of valour of the queen, the show gives an emotive account of the first war of independence. to make the experience more comprehensive, the show is organised at the jhansi fort, which was a site of the battle. it is truly spine-chilling to watch the story unfold and slowly move into an action-packed battle. the jhansi fort was built in the 17th century by king bir singh deo of orchha as an army stronghold.
