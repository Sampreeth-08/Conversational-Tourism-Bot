ker sangri
ker sangri is a traditional rajasthani dish made with dried ker berry and sangri beans, and is extremely popular among vegetarians. a typical desert vegetable, ker is found in the more arid parts of rajasthan. it was discovered during a long period of famine â€“ when every other vegetable had died, these long beans and berries grew in abundance, allowing the villagers to survive the famine, while also inventing a dish that would become a must at every marwari wedding. it has a tangy flavour and goes down well with bajra roti.
in its raw form, ker is very sour, and is therefore soaked in salt water, washed and dried in the sun before being cooked. sangri beans are plucked while they are still raw, boiled, and then sun-dried. they can be preserved for up to a year.
