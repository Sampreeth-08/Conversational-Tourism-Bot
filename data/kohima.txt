kohima
description
a carpet of lush emerald green, dotted with colourful blooms, kohima, the capital of nagaland looks like an artist's canvas. kohima is called the land of the angami naga tribe and derives its name from 'kewhira' or 'kewhima', meaning the land where the kewhi flower grows. the city serpentines along the mountain ranges to the top and offers a pristine and seamless blend of nature and tribal traditions and culture. set against the backdrop of the japfu mountain range, the city boasts a rocky terrain and many scenic trails that are ideal for adventure-lovers and thrill-seekers. the japfu peak, the second highest in the state (3,048 m), is a trekking paradise as it offers one of the most challenging treks in the region that takes you through picturesque routes. tourists can also indulge in mountain climbing and jungle camping.
the best time to enjoy the city is during the internationally renowned hornbill festival that is a mosaic of culture, festivities, dance, art, crafts, food and music. the annual jamboree, held in december, sees thousands of footfalls and the city truly comes alive during it.
home to a sizeable tribal population, the most dominant of which are the angami nagas, kohima retains its traditional charm, which can be experienced in its various heritage villages or homestay experiences.
