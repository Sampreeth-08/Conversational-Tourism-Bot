barua sagar fort
standing tall on a high ground overlooking an ancient lake, barua sagar fort is a majestic landmark, around 20 km from the cities of orchha and jhansi, that lies on the route to khajuraho. the fort marks the battleground of the war that was fought in 1744 between the marathas and the bundelas. it overlooks the beautiful baruasagar tal (lake) that was formed about 260 years ago, when an embankment was erected by king udit singh of orchha. the embankment structure is a unique example of architecture and engineering. on the north-east side of the lake are the ruins of two old chandela temples built with granite. the fort sitting by the lake makes for a picturesque setting. one should not forget to tote their cameras while visiting this scenic spot.
