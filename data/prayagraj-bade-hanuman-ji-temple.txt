bade hanuman ji temple
close to the prayagraj fort is another attractionÂ  the bade hanumanji temple. also known as lete hanuman temple, it enshrines a 20-ft-long idol of the deity, in a supine or reclining position. it is the only temple of its kind in the world where lord hanuman is worshipped in this position. legend has it that after burning lanka, as mentioned in the epic ramayana, lord hanuman was tired and on the insistence of goddess sita, laid down to rest at the site where now stands the red-stone temple. what's interesting about this shrine is that the idol of the lord appears some six to seven ft under the ground in a pit bordered by red-orange pillars and fences.
