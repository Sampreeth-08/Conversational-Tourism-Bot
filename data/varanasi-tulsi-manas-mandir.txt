tulsi manas mandir
paying homage to the 6th-century indian bhakti poet goswami tulsidas, the author of the epic ramcharitramanas, the tulsi manas mandir was constructed in 1964. made with white marble, the temple is beautifully landscaped and has verses and scenes from the ramcharitramanas engraved on its walls. located close to the banaras hindu university, it has a lot of historic and cultural importance primarily because goswami tulsidas is credited with popularising the indian epic ramayan, by writing it in awadhi, a dialect of the hindi language, thereby making it accessible to the masses. the temple is dedicated to lord rama and lies in close proximity to the famous durga temple. it houses beautiful idols of lord rama, goddess sita, lord lakshmana and lord hanuman. it also has a lovely garden.
