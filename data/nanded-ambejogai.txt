ambejogai
located in the marathwad region, ambajogai is visited by hundreds of travellers because this is where famous marathi poet saints, mukundraj maharaj and dasopant, were born and spent their lives. the memorial of mukundraj is located in a nearby valley. followers flock to ambajogai to visit their shrines. a number of other popular temples in the vicinity include the yogeshwari mandir, amleshwar temple, kholeshwar temple, nagzari tirth, shri ganesh mandir, narsinh tirth, jain caves and the sakaleshwar mandir. the yogeshwari mandir is believed to be a shaktipeeth (where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell) and hence receives a large footfall throughout the year.
