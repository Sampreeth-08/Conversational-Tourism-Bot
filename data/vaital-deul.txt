vaital-deul 
the vaital deul temple in bhubaneswar, well-known for its striking structure, displays the khakhara style of architecture - a subdivision of the kalinga school that is believed to have specifically been used to design shrines set up by tantric groups. the semi-cylindrical shape of the temple's roof is typical of the khakhara order of temples that are said to have an affinity to the dravidian gopuram (gate) of the south indian temples. there are gabled towers with a row of shikharas (spires), another sign of south indian influence. the deul, or tower, of the temple is its most distinct feature. rectangular in shape, it is positioned at a right angle to the jagmohana or porch. tantric worship, said to have combined elements of hinduism and buddhism, was centred on the worship of goddess shakti, the female life force. 
the idol of chamunda, the presiding deity of this temple, is dimly visible behind the grill and she has a garland of skulls around her neck. she can be seen holding a bow, snake, shield, sword, trident, thunderbolt and an arrow. she is seated on a corpse, flanked by an owl and a jackal. there are 15 niches around the idol with singular images. the figures in vaital deul are executed in relief and have delicate features and perfect equipoise. the temple design is unlike the dominant odishan type and many say it resembles a buddhist chaitya hall. the rathas of mahabalipuram are said to have been the inspiration behind the shape of the vaital in this temple. this hindu temple is said to have been constructed sometime in the 8th century. there are three spires at the top of the temple that are the reason it is also known as 'tini-mundia deula'. it is believed that the three spires represent the three powers of goddess chamunda - mahasaraswati, mahalakshmi and mahakali.
