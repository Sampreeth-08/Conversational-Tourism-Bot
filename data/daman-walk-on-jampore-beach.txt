walk on jampore beach
surrounded by lush green groves of casuarina trees, this quaint beach surprises you with its serenity. from taking a long stroll on the beach or just feeling the cool breeze hit your face to enjoying a camel or horse ride and capturing beautiful sunsets your camera, a visit to the jampore beach is one of the most amazing and enriching experiences one can have in daman. you can collect pretty shells and conch lying around the beach and take them home as memorabilia. the beach is a stoneâ€™s throw away from the moti daman jetty.
