vada pav
colloquially known as vada pav, it is a type of indian burger that is made from boiled potato stuffing dipped in gram flour batter and deep fried then served on a bun or a bread slice. it is relished by locals and tourists alike and is considered soul-food by mumbaikars. it is believed to have been invented by ashok vaidya in 1966, who opened a small stall serving this snack, opposite to the dadar train station. thousands of workers often looking for a quick and cheap snack would flock to his stall. soon, vada pav became a hit with not just workers but most people of the city. today, every street corner of mumbai has a vendor selling vada pav.
