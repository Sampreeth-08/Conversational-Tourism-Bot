prayagraj 
kumbh-mela 
kumbh mela is probably the largest human congregation in the world that takes place at the sacred triveni sangam, which is a confluence of three holy rivers - ganga, yamuna and mystical saraswati. it is celebrated every six years and sees a sea of devotees flowing into the city. the fair is held over a span of 55 days across an area of 1,000 hectare. the most prominent feature of the mela is the bathing ritual, where millions of devotees, saffron-clad saints and sadhus (holy men) take a holy dip in the water. it is said that bathing in the water of the sangam during this time absolves one of their sins. such is the renown of the mela that it draws sadhus and ascetics from the remotest corners of the country. it is indeed a spell-binding sight to see the naga sadhus, who smear their naked bodies with ash and tie their hair in dreadlocks, heading towards the water with all the bravado of a charging army. 
 
legend has it that once lord vishnu was carrying the pot (kumbh) of nectar (amrit) when four drops fell down on earth after a brief scuffle with demons. these four drops fell at the holy places of ujjain, nashik, haridwar and prayagraj. this event is commemorated every three years, at each place in turn. kumbh mela at prayagraj is very different from the melas at other places. the tradition of long-term kalpvas (a brief stay) is practised only here. it is believed that lord brahma (creator of the universe) performed the yajna (a fire ritual) here for creating the universe.
