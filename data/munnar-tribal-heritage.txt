tribal heritage
kerala is home to a number of tribal communities and the mannans and the palians are among the most prominent tribes of munnar. the tribal heritage programme of the state government is aimed at providing a glimpse of tribal life to tourists. about a couple of hours long, it involves trekking through dense forests and visiting a tribal hamlet nestled at the periphery of the periyar tiger reserve. tourists can take the tour every day from 8 am to 12 noon and from 2 pm to 4 pm.
you will be accompanied by a tribal guide on the nature trail. allow the guide to take you to the houses of the tribals as you walk amidst lush green surroundings, with chirping birds adding to the background music. the tribals have been living in grey-thatched houses for centuries and visiting one such house makes for a fascinating experience as one gets to interact with tribals and get an insight into their lifestyle. a visit to the tribal heritage museum, set up in the tribal hamlet of the mannan community, is also a part of the tour. the museum displays a great collection of tribal artefacts, which are used by the members for special ceremonies, rituals, cultural events and agricultural practices. visitors also get a chance to see the dresses worn by tribals, along with other objects like traditional fishing gear, weapons used for hunting, cooking utensils and tribal paintings.
