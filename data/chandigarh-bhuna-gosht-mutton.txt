bhuna gosht mutton
a host of spices and yoghurt are used to make this richly flavoured traditional mutton curry.Â  the gosht is cooked for a long time to ensure the flavours are well infused into the meat. the word 'bhuna' in asian cooking means cooking the curry until it is reduced and becomes thick. this way it gets coated to the meat very easily. served with jeera (cumin) rice, bhuna gosht makes a great option for lunch or dinner.
