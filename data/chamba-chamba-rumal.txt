chamba rumal
made on soft silk and muslin, chamba rumal (handkerchief) is famous for its embroidery and size. these rumals draw inspiration from epics like the ramayana and the mahabharata. some of the popular themes are lord krishna with gopis at the time of godhuli (the time of the day when lord krishna and his cowherd friends returned home) and images of goddess radha and lord krishna. these designs are similar to those used in pahari paintings. other famous designs are royal hunts, court scenes, depiction of dice game of chaupad and wedding processions. the rumalsâ€™ borders are a blend of geometrical and floral designs. these conventionally depict floral patterns along with geometrical settings -- squares and parallel lines. these borders are considered to be the frame in which a central picture is made. this art form received the patronage of the rulers of the kingdom of chamba. the artists from the mughal court, which dad considerably waekened by then, were offered patronage by raja umed singh (1748-68), the ruler of chamba and the patronage continued under raj singh (1764-94) and later charat singh (1794-1808).
