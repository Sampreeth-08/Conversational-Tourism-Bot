jarai ka math
located about 20 km from orchha and displaying stunning pratihara style of architecture, the jarai ka math temple has been earmarked as a heritage site by the archaeological survey of india (asi). constructed by mihir bhoja, a pratihara king in 860 ad, this red sandstone temple, with four sub-shrines, is dedicated to goddess amba, whose multiple forms are intricately carved on the temple walls. the idol or the image of the main deity is missing from the sanctum sanctorum. only, a pedestal and a statue of the jewelled right foot of a female on a lotus stalk can be seen. however, there is a miniature, sixteen-armed idol of a goddess kept on the central lintel of the entrance. this further supports the belief that the temple was initially built for a goddess.
