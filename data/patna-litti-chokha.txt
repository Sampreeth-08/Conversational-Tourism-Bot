litti chokha
litti chokha, considered to be the mainstay of the local bhojpuri cuisine, is a popular winter street food in patna. it consists of dough balls made with wheat flour and filled with sattu (a flour made with roasted gram) and spices, which are either roasted or fried. the roasted ones are often dipped in ghee (clarified butter) before being served. the litti is served with chokha, which is mashed boiled potato and brinjal, flavoured with chopped onion, tomato and coriander leaves. litti can also be eaten with a spicy mutton gravy.
