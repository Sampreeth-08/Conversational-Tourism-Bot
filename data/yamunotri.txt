yamunotri
description
yamunotri makes one of the four pious hindu pilgrimage places in the great himalayas. the other three are gangotri, kedarnath and badrinath, and all of these destinations are together called the char dham. most hindus believe that their spiritual journey is not complete without visiting all the dhams and the journey they undertake is known as char dham yatra.
yamunotri is the commencing point of the pilgrimage that proceeds to gangotri and finally to kedarnath and badrinath. thousands of devotees arrive at yamunotri every year to start their spiritual journey. the second sacred river of the hindus, the yamuna, also originates from here and devotees offer prayers at the origin point, the yamunotri glacier (6,387 m). it is believed that bathing in the waters of the river keeps one from an untimely death. the presiding deity at yamunotri is goddess yamuna, and one of the most sacred areas is divya shila, a dark rock from where the famed hot springs emerge. to reach here, believers undertake an arduous journey through the mighty himalayas.
the spiritual town of yamunotri lies in the garhwal himalayas at an elevation of about 3,293 m. the pristine landscape hosts lush green fields, the mighty yamunotri glacier, hot springs and lakes. the town stands high on the deep left of the western face of the bandarpunch peak.
