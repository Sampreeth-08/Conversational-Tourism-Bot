red fort
lying at the heart of delhi, the majestic red fort, made of fine red sandstone, stands as a testament to the architectural legacy of the mughals. one of the most beautiful monuments in the world, this unesco world heritage site, famous as qila-e-mubaraq, is replete with palaces, pavilions and mosques.
built by mughal emperor shah jahan as the palace fort of his capital shahjahanabad, red fort is famous for its massive enclosing walls. the architecture of the fort reflects a seamless fusion of islamic, persian, timurid and hindu styles. the major attractions are the diwan-i-khas, also known as the shah mahal, the diwan-i-aam or the hall of public audience and the rang mahal (a part of the harem), also known as imtiyaz mahal. the other monuments here are the naubat khana (drum house), where royal musicians played and announced the arrival of royal family members; the hammam (royal bath), and the muthamman burj, or musaman burj (a tower where the emperor would show himself to his subjects). once the power of the mughals weakend, the fort was plundered by the persians, led by nadir shah, in 1739. the invaders took away much of the fort's treasures, including the opulent peacock throne, which shah jahan had crafted out of gold and gemstones (including the precious kohinoor diamond).
