pathar-masjid 
this famous masjid, or mosque lies just behind the tomb of sheikh chilli in bari mohalla. it is believed to have been created in the 17th century and the architectural style also hints the same. famous for its fluted minarets, attached to the back wall, pathar masjid is a beautiful monument built in red sandstone. floral motifs, carved in low relief on the pillars of the mosque on which the ceiling rests are so intricate that it is worth visiting the mosque just to see them. the qibla, pointing in the direction of the holy mecca, is flanked on either side by arched niches, which are inscribed with quran verses. the masjid is a beautiful specimen of architecture of that time.
