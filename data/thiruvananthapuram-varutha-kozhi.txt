varutha kozhi
a famous local delicacy, varutha kozhi is a combination of vinegar, chillies, onions and coriander leaves and is served on a banana leaf. it is generally a semi-thick gravy, and prepared as a side dish for the classic rasam rice preparation, or with idli, dosa and other breakfast dishes. traditionally, it is quite spicy, and is therefore best consumed with a milder item to balance the flavours.
