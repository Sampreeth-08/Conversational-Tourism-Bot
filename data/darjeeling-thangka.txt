thangka
a thangka is a buddhist scroll or fabric temple banner, which is painted on cotton or silk fabric. in darjeeling, thangkas are beautified with paintings depicting the various forms of lord buddha, as well as episodes from his life. traditionally, these thangkas are as intricate as they are exquisite, and are kept unframed.
during prayers and festivals, they are placed against a textile frame, and then rolled back up and stored in dry places where heat and other elements will not damage the integrity of the work.Â a thangka, also known as tanka, is typically small, but some pieces measure several meters in length, and are meant to be hung on the walls of monasteries.
