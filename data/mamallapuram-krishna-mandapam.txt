krishna mandapam
the largest mandapam in mamallapuram is dedicated to lord krishna. inside this mandapam, are bas-reliefs and carvings depicting scenes of village life from govardhan, with special emphasis on pastoral life, including a shepherd milking a cow, a farmer carrying his child on his shoulder, a shepherdess with a rolled mat on her head, a young couple pictured beautifully, etc. the largest carving narrates the story of how lord krishna saved the village of govardhan from lord indra's wrath by carrying the entire mountain on his finger for nearly an entire week to protect the people and the cattle, while it rained so severely that everything could have drowned. the krishna mandapam is situated right next to arjuna's penance and shares the same complex with the ganesha ratha and the krishna butter ball.
