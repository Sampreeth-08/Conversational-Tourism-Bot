santa-cruz-basilica 
one of the eight magnificent basilicas in india, santa cruz basilica was constructed by the portuguese in 1505. boasting two lofty spires that can be seen from a distance, this pristine white structure has a contrasting vividly painted interior. the overwhelming arches and the altar add medieval touches to the church's architecture. tourists would be especially awed by seven canvas paintings that have been inspired by the 'last supper' by leonardo da vinci. as you gaze at the mesmeric ceiling, beautifully adorned with paintings depicting scenes from the via crucis of christ, you are left marvelling at the skill of the artisans of that time. don't miss out the intricate wall carvings and stained glass windows that enhance the beauty of the church. 
 
santa cruz basilica lies in close proximity to the st francis church, which is one of the most beautiful cathedrals in the country.
