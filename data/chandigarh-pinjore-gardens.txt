pinjore gardens
also called yadavindra gardens, the beautiful and scenic pinjore gardens have been laid out in a mughal style. the gardens were designed in the 17th century by nawab fidal khan, who was the architect commissioned by mughal emperor aurangzeb. the gardens stretch over an area of about 100 acre and are known for their lush greenery, refreshing fountains and serene water bodies. they are a fine specimen of terraced gardening in india. if you are visiting here, try to time your visit to coincide with the celebrations of the harvest festival of baisakhi, between april and june, when the gardens host the annual mango festival. the gardens also house a mini zoo, a japanese garden, a nursery and various picnic spots.
