varanasi
spiritual
durga mandir
known as monkey temple due to the presence of a number of monkeys there. within the compound is a kund (pond), lined by stone stairs on all sides and watch-pillars standing at each corner.Â  the temple is an important pilgrimage site for hindu devotees, especially during navaratri (a hindu festival during which the goddess is worshipped). among the devotees, there is a popular belief that the idol of goddess durga came into being on its own, and the red hues of the temple are a tribute to the goddess who is associated with the colour. many believe that the goddess protects devotees from problems.
there is another famous durga temple in varanasi that goes by the name of brahmacharini durga temple. it is located close to the durga ghat (means durga kund) at the bank of ganga.
