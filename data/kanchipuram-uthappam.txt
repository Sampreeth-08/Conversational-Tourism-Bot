uthappam
prepared from lentils and rice flour, uthappam is spread on a flat pan and seasoned with fresh vegetables. it is best eaten with sambar or coconut chutney. the uthappam is different from dosa in that it is much thicker and smaller, making use of more batter. it is fluffy and flavoursome, and at times is smeared with a combination of red chilli paste and ghee (clarified butter) while still on the pan.
