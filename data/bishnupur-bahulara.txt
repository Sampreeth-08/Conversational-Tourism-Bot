bahulara
bahulara is famous for its siddeshwara shiva temple that is unique due to its architectural style and exquisite brick cut. it is located on a high ritualistic mound made on the lines of kalinga architecture. since a majority of the temples in the area have a similar mound, archaeologists believe that bishnupur was a thriving buddhist centre at a given point of time in history. one can also find similar styles in the nearby areas of dihar, gokulnagar, joykrishnapur etc. some of the ruins are considered to be the remains of stupas.
