thukpa
thukpa is a tibetan hot noodle soup cooked with meat, eggs and vegetables, and served in a large bowl. it is a lip-smacking comfort food, filling and healthy. extremely popular in the northeastern states of india, this soup is the perfect meal in winter, warming you up from the inside out.
there are a number of variants of thukpa, and while the traditional recipe calls for meat (usually chicken or pork), a number of vegetarian options have also been introduced in restaurants across the board. you can use mushroom, spring onion, carrot, cabbage and other vegetables, along with a vegetable broth, and then add a medley of your favourite spices (predominantly chili powder) and have a yummy, nutritious and soul-satisfying feast.
