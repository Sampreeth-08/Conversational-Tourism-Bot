munroe island
nestled in the beautiful backwaters of kollam, munroe island is a hidden gem of kerala that leaves tourists enchanted with its unparalleled beauty. surrounded by the serene ashtamudi lake and kallada river, the island offers amazing views of verdant coconut plantations. the best way to enjoy the tranquillity of the island is to take a canoe ride through the narrow canals of the backwaters. the ride takes you through tiny hamlets located along the backwaters and provides a glimpse of the daily life of villagers. the best rides are the ones taken during early morning and evening because they offer you a chance to witness ethereal sunrises and sunsets. the authentic food joints located at the island provide tempting delicacies made from coconut oil. the island is also famous for hosting the kallada boat race, which is held here during the 10-day long onam festival. the island has been named after resident colonel john munroe of the former princely state of travancore who is credited for integrating several backwater regions by digging canals. the island is located on the outskirts of the city and makes for a great one day trip.
