bhakti-dham 
bhakti dham, located in dindori naka, is famous for its majority of temples and hence is a centre of religious activities. it is dedicated to lord krishna and his divine consort, goddess radha. in the main sanctum, you will find intricately carved sculptures of lord krishna and goddess radha, as well as the idol of sant jalaram bappa, a hindu saint from gujarat. 
 
the temple has been superbly crafted out of pale red stone, and has a huge tiled courtyard where pilgrims and students can sit quietly and meditate, or hold group discussions on modern implications on age-old religious teachings. behind the temple lies a park, where you can stroll under a canopy of leafy trees, or just sit and soak in the peace and quiet of bhakti dham. 
 
the dham is visited by people who seek to have discussions on religion and scriptures and there are a variety of religious books in the campus for their aid. over the years, efforts have been made to make bhakti dham a foremost authority on vedic preaching, studies and research.
