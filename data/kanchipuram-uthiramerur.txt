uthiramerur
the main attraction in the quaint town of uthiramerur is vaikunta perumal, an ancient temple dedicated to lord vishnu. a lovely example of south india’s dravidian style of architecture, the temple covers an area of about half an acre.
here, vishnu’s divine consort is worshipped as anandavalli. the sanctum sanctorum houses an idol of lord vishnu with his companions, sridevi and bhudevi, on either side. the assembly hall is pillar-less, supported only by the roof. however, the most unique and impressive aspect of the temple is this: on its walls, inscriptions dating as far back as the 10th century were found that indicated to the strong political and administrative machinery, as well as a self-governance system of the cholas. now, the temple has been declared as a heritage monument and is protected by the archaeological survey of india.
