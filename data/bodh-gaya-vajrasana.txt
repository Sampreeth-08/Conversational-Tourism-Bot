vajrasana
the red sandstone slab between the bodhi tree and the mahabodhi temple is said to have been erected by emperor ashoka to mark the exact position where lord buddha sat. it is traditionally called buddha’s vajrasana (meaning diamond throne or thunder seat). it is said lord buddha sat here in meditation gazing eastwards. one of the most famous of ashoka’s many pillars (on which he had engraved his edicts and his understanding of religious doctrine), it stands at the southeast corner of the temple. vajrasana has been mentioned in the work of many scholars like ashvaghosa, who in his buddhacharita reveals that this seat is the “navel of the earth”; fa-hien mentions that all the past buddhas attained enlightenment here and the future buddhas too will attain enlightenment at this spot.
