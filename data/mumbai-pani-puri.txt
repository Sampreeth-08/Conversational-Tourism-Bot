pani puri
pani puri is a common street snack in several cities of india. it is made from flour, which is fried into puffed balls, and then filled with spiced cumin and mint water, onions, potatoes and chickpeas. this delicious snack has a legend associated with it and it is said that the recipe of the dish dates back to the mahabharata era. as the story goes, when draupadi married the five pandava brothers, in order to test her household skills, their mother kunti, gave her all the vegetables in the house along with a little dough to make a meal for the family. then, draupadi made a dish very similar to the pani puri that we eat today.
