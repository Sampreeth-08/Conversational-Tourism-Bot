zafrani kheer
one of the best nawabi dishes, zafrani kheer is the perfect finish to any meal. a dessert made with milk, boiled rice, cardamom and delicate strands of saffron, it is garnished with almond and chopped cashew nuts fried in ghee (clarified butter). the garnish imparts a distinct flavour to the kheer, which is filling and tastes heavenly. this dish is a variant of the simple kheer, which is one of the most popular desserts in indian cooking, with several versions across the country. the zafrani version is mostly prepared during special occasions like weddings as well as religious celebrations.
