arambor beach
beautiful and peaceful, arambol beach, also known as harmal beach, is particularly popular with international travellers. you'll find a number of tai chi, yoga and meditation centres along with kiosks for non-permanent henna tattoos here. sunsets are especially picturesque, with black rocks creating a dramatic effect against the pristine sand and the multi-hued sky. a pool of yellow clay, a short walk away, is believed to possess healing properties.
