sadaqat ashram
located approximately 7 km from the airport, on the banks of the ganga river, the sadaqat ashram lies beside the main road of the digha area in a peaceful area. the sadaqat ashram is where india's first president, dr rajendra prasad lived after his retirement in 1962. the last days of his life were spent in the calm environs of this ashram. today, there is a small museum called the rajendra smriti sangrahalaya that displays his personal belongings as well as several items that were used in indiaâ€™s freedom struggle. besides, there are several grand paintings on display.
this ashram was established by mahatma gandhi in 1921. the land for the ashram, believed to be spread across 20 acres of lush greenery, is said to have been donated by khairun miya, who was a friend of maulana mazharul haque, who in turn was a close associate of gandhiji. khairun miya had donated this piece of land to help further the national movement and several important meetings of well-known freedom fighters were held here. today, the premises also house the maulana mazharul haque library, which has a reading room with a good collection of books.
