thenmala
thenmala prides itself as india's first planned eco-tourism site. it has 10 eco-tourism spots that cover the great hill ranges of thiruvananthapuram, pathanamthitta and kollam districts. home to a variety of deer like spotted deer, lawn deer and sambar, it is a popular picnic spot. a walk through the forest is not only a peaceful experience but also introduces you to a huge variety of trees present in the region. the beautiful statue of a deer named krishna makes for a nice photography spot. the park also houses a few tree top huts and a deer rehabilitation centre, where various species of deer are bred. there's also a recreational area with various swings and slides for children. the word 'thenmala' translates into a honey hill and it is believed that honey collected here is of premium quality due to the region’s biological composition.  the best time to visit thenmala is between the months of december and february.
