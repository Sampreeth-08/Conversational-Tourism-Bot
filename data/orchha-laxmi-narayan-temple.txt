laxmi narayan temple
built during the rule of raja bir singh deo, the lakshmi narayan temple is dedicated to goddess lakshmi (the goddess of wealth and prosperity). its structure exemplifies a unique blend of temple and fort architecture. built with lime mortar and bricks, the temple has cannon slots on its roof. its well-preserved frescos portray an amalgamation of mughal and bundelkhandi art and the carvings on the inside depict the life of lord krishna. the temple also has the famous post-mutiny paintings. another interesting feature is that it has a flagstone path that connects it to the ram raja temple. other notable aspects of the temple are the carvings on the central dome and ornately carved pillars on the corners. visitors should also see the famous painting of the legendary 'shungi chirya', which is a monstrous bird that could capture elephants in its talons. there is no idol of the goddess inside the temple.
