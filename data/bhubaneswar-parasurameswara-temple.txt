parasurameswara temple
constructed around 650 ad, the parasurameswara temple is considered to be one of the oldest surviving temples in odisha. it is a great example of odia temple architecture, having the characteristic deul (tower) and jagmohana (porch-like-hall). though small in size, it is beautifully decorated with exquisite carvings and sculptures and enclosed within a compound wall. the temple is dedicated to lord shiva. one can also find bas reliefs of elephant processions and a buddhist stupa carved here.
