dubare elephant camp
located in dubare, a natural island formed by river cauvery, this camp is an elephant conservatory, housing about 150 animals currently. a fun and interesting spot to interact and learn more about the mammal, the camp offers opportunities to visitors to feed the animals with jaggery, coconuts, banana, sugarcane and ragi. tourists can also watch the animals being given a scrub-bath, after which oil is applied to their forehead and tusks. besides, you can indulge in elephant rides, coracle rides in the cauvery river, angling, river rafting, bird-watching and trekking. while going on coracle rides, if you're lucky, you can spot the crocodiles basking in the sun. the elephants cared for in the camp are also a part of the famous mysore dussehra.
the camp is a project undertaken by the forest department, and naturalists, who are experts in elephant history, ecology and biology, have been hired to educate visitors about the animals, and reinstate how important it is that they be protected and treated with kindness. many homestays and resorts have been set up near the reserve, so guests can stay for a longer period and take a jeep safari into the jungle. the best time to visit the camp is between september and march.
