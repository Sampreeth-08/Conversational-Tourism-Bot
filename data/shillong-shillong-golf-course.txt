shillong golf course
shillong boasts one of the oldest and the best natural golf courses in the world. it is considered to be the "gleneagle of the east" by the united states golf association and museum. situated at an elevation of aboutÂ  5,200 ft in an undulating valley, it is covered in thick groves of pine and rhododendron trees, and comprises nine holes. the gold course was built in 1898 and was converted to an 18- hole course in 1924.
golf was introduced to the city of shillong by a group of british civil service officers in 1898. the beauty of the golf course is such that it appeals to non-golf players as well. the course is almost always wet and that adds to the charm of the place.
