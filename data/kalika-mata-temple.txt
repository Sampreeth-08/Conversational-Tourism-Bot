kalika-mata-temple 
the ancient kalika mata temple is one of the most captivating sights in chittorgarh. drawing influences from the architecture of pratihara times (8th to 11th century), this temple is located on an elevated podium and the intricately sculpted mandap, ceilings, pillars and entry gates are a treat to the eyes. the temple complex is huge and 'ratri jagrans' (nightly prayers) are organised here. the complex also has a temple dedicated to lord shiva called jogeshwar mahadev. the temple is lit up during navratris when it sees excessive footfalls. it was originally built as a shrine dedicated to the sun god in the 8th century, however, in the 14th century, a temple dedicated to goddess kali was made from its ruins. located between the padmini palace and victory tower, the temple is a prominent pilgrimage for devotees.
