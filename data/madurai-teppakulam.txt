teppakulam
a stone's throw from the famous meenakshi temple, teppakulam, literally meaning a temple pond used for devotional purposes, is a must-visit site for devotees. dedicated to  lord vigneshwara (a form of lord ganesha), this temple is known for a huge tank in its precincts that holds the record for being the biggest tank in tamil nadu. with ghats on four sides, each having 12 long steps made of granite, the pond houses a mandapam called maiya mandapam, which has an idol of lord ganesha. one of the most colourful temple festivals, the float festival that marks the birth anniversary of king thirumalai nayak, ruler of madurai is held here in the month of thai (january-february) every year. on the occasion, goddess meenakshi and lord sundareshwar are taken to the tank on an illuminate theppam (float) which is decorated with colourful flowers. hundreds of devotees watch the theppam move around the water tank with traditional music playing in the background. legend has it that the tank was dug to use the sand from this place to construct the beautiful thirumala nayakar palace. it was later covered with bricks to be used as a water tank. another legend says that the idol of the lord was also obtained from this tank.
