ravanahatha
the land of rajasthan still cultivates and nurtures its old traditions and there is no dearth of ancient musical instruments in the state. ravanahatha, being one of the oldest, is largely used by local and street musicians. it is an ancient bowed, stringed instrument and has been suggested as the ancestor of the violin. in fact, even the method of playing is almost identical to that of the violin.
