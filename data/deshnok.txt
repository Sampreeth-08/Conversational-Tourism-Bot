deshnok 
deshnok is famous for the temple of karni mata, who is believed to be an incarnation of goddess durga. famed as the rat temple, as rats and mice are worshipped, it is one of india's most fascinating temples that draws devotees from all over the world. the temple houses as many as 25,000 rats who are known as kaabas. it is considered highly auspicious to have a white kaaba run across your feet as they are believed to be the sons of karni mata. around 600 families of the charan clan claim to be the descendants of karni mata and believe that they will be reincarnated as rats. 
 
one of the popular legends associated with the temple is that when laxmana, the stepson of karni mata drowned in the kapil sarovar while attempting to drink water, karni mata prayed to yama raj (the god of death) so ardently that he not only brought back laxmana to life but reincarnated all her sons in the form of rats. 
 
the structure of the temple was completed in the early 20th century by maharaja ganga singh of bikaner (1888-1943). don't forget to make a wish in the lion's ears at the main gate before you leave the temple complex. tourists can also visit the recently built karni mata panorama located on the way back to bikaner from deshnok. the recently built museum depict the stories of karni mata through beautiful sculptures, paintings and tableaus.
