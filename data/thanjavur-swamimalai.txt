swamimalai
lying in close proximity to thanjavur, swamimalai temple, dedicated to lord murugan, is perched on a hillock. one needs to climb 60 steep steps to reach it that represent 60 years of the hindu years cycle. legend says that lord murugan himself taught the meaning of the pranaya mantra meant to worship his father lord shiva, at this site once. swamimalai is also believed to be one of the six holy abodes of lord murugan. it is known as the padai veedugal (battle camps) of lord murugan. there is also a shrine of lord shiva situated just a little below the temple on the hillock. the best time to visit the temple is during temple car festival, held in april and panguni uthiram festival organised during the month of march.
