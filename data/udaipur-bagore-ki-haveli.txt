standing on the waterfront of lake pichola at gangori ghat is the stunning  bagore ki haveli. constructed in the 18th century by amar chand badwa, the then prime minister of mewar kingdom, bagore ki haveli was a private property till india's independence. today, this mansion with ostentatious architecture, is a museum. reflecting mewarâ€™s rich heritage, bagore ki haveli has an assortment of huge courtyards, balconies, jharokhas, archways, cupolas and a fountain. with around 138 rooms, the interiors of the haveli are decorated with alluring glasswork and murals, including the chambers of the royal ladies, renowned for intricate stained glass windows.
the marvels of architecture are visible as one enters the high gates of the haveli, being welcomed into an attractive courtyard with a double-layered lotus fountain at its centre. as you walk inside, a row of rooms on the right offer splendid views of lake pichola. the haveli has three chowks: kuan chowk, neem chowk and tulsi chowk, the latter reserved for women of the family. the kanch mahal (mirrored passage) and durrie khana were areas used only by the men of the family. diwan-e-khas was the largest chamber.
