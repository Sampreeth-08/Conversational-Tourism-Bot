this sweet curd makes for a lovely ending to a delicious meal. it is different from yoghurt in the technique by which it is made. to prepare it, milk is boiled until it is slightly thickened. it is then sweetened with sugar, dates and allowed to ferment overnight. it is usually stored in an earthenware as gradual water evaporation through its pores thickens it. it is garnished with cardamom.
