kolukkumalai tea plantation
enjoy a cup of tea at the highest plantation in the world, 38 km away from munnar. the hill top is accessible only by jeep. one can have a breathtaking view of the munnar valley from here. at about 7,900 ft above sea level, you can even glimpse the neighbouring state of tamil nadu. for a trekker, a walk through these hills is a must-do.
