irani chai
iconic in hyderabad, this milky concoction of tea leaves, whole milk, sugar and khoya or mawa (milk reduced to a solid form) is a must-try. this tea is best enjoyed with the special hyderabadi osmania biscuits. it is believed to be brought to hyderabad by persian immigrants who landed at mumbai port and then migrated to pune and hyderabad. the preparation of irani chai is different from that of normal tea. to make this rich tea, tea leaves are boiled in a separate container and milk in another. while serving to customers, milk is poured first and then the tea leaves concoction.
