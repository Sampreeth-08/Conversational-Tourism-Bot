feroz shah kotla fort
one of the oldest structures in delhi, feroz shah kotla fort was built by sultan feroz shah tughlaq in 1354. according to historical sources, this fort was built when the ruler decided to shift his capital from tughlaqabad to firozabad due to the scarcity of water at the former capital. hence, the fort was built on the banks of the holy yamuna river to serve the purpose. the fort has some magnificent gardens, mosques, palaces etc., in its complex. the entrance of the fort has a gigantic iron gate with the name of the ruler and the boundary of the fort walls are as high as 15 m. though a number of structures in the fort are in ruins, the stepwell (baoli) is still in good condition. one of the interesting features of the fort is that it houses an ashokan pillar, which was brought by feroz shah from ambala to delhi. it is 13 m high and bears the inscriptions of ashoka's principles.
