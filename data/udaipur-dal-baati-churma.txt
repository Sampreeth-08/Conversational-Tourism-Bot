dal baati churma
the state of rajastan is synonymous with dal-baati-churma, which is a curation of lentil curry (dal), wheat rolls (baati) and crushed wheat balls soaked in plenty of ghee (clarified butter) and sugar. this dish is an attempt to bring all the flavours together in a single meal and thus, while the dal is thick and spicy, the almost plain baati complements it nicely. in addition, a helping of churma makes sure that sweet flavours are close at hand.
