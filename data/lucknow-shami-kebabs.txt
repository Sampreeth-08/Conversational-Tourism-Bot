shami kebabs
a delicacy curated during the rule of the nawabs, shami kebabs are one of the most popular snacks in the city. they are known for their fine textured meat, softness and aromatic flavour. round patties full of spices, raw mango and bengal gram are pan-fried to create a crispy exterior that is increasingly soft on the inside. kairi or raw mango is the main ingredient of the dish.
to prepare these kebabs, lamb meat is boiled or saut√©ed, and then ground with chickpeas. a blend of spices (garam masala, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves and bay leaves) is added to the mixture, along with whole ginger, garlic, onions, green chillies, turmeric, red chilli powder and chopped mint leaves. some recipes call for an egg to be added as well, in order to hold the kebab together. most restaurants in the city also serve vegetarian versions of the kebabs.
