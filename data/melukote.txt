melukote 
the land where saint ramanujam walked over a thousand years ago, melukote is a well-known pilgrim centre for the vaishnava community that attracts lakhs of devotees during the famous vauramudi festival. it is located in the mandya district, easily accessible from the bengaluru-mysore highway. 
the yaganarasimha swamy and cheluvanarayan swamy temples found here are centuries old. the cheluvanarayan swamy temple, dedicated to lord vishnu, was at one time frequented by the kings of mysore, and has a lovely collection of jewels. at the time of vauramudi (an annual spiritual event), the idol of the god wearing a diamond-encrusted crown, is carried out of the temple as part of a procession. the academy of sanskrit research is also based in melukote, which was once famous for its handlooms.
