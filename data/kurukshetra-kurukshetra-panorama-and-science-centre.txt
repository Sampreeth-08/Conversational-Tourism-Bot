kurukshetra panorama and science centre
a unique combination of science and religion, the central attraction of the science centre is a life-like panorama of the battle of kurukshetra. the exhibit gives travellers an alternate and scientific reading of various events of the battle. built in a cylindrical shape, the centre is home to a number of interesting exhibits on ancient indian concepts of properties of matter, structure of atoms, geometry, arithmetical rules, astronomy, medicine and surgery.
one should not miss the panorama of the battle of kurukshetra that is on display in the institution. it showcases the battle of mahabharata and offers a scientific explanation of each episode of the battle. there are several paintings that are part of the exhibit, some as high as 34 ft, which create a larger than life experience into lore and science of the mahabharata war. the park outside has been used as an informal space for science exhibits for children that impart scientific knowledge in informal and interactive ways.
