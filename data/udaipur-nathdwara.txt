nathdwara
on the bank of river banas is located the holy city of nathdwara, renowned for a much-revered temple of lord krishna. situated around 48 km away from udaipur, the town derives its name from two words: ‘nath’ meaning the lord and 'dwar' meaning a gate. the 17th century temple dedicated to lord shrinathji (an incarnation of lord krishna) is housed in a beautiful complex with intricately carved structures. the idol of the lord is carved out of a single black stone and depicts lord shrinathji (this term is used for krishna when he lifted the govardhana hill ) with his left hand raised and the right hand bunched into a fist.
the temple's gaushala (cow shed) houses more than 500 cows and holi, janmashtami and annakutta festivals are celebrated with great pomp and enthusiasm. nathdwara is also popular for its pichhwai paintings, which are colourful representations of lord krishna on fabric or cloth. it is also popular for mouth-watering sweets.
