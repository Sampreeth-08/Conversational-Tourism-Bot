pali
located almost 70 km away from jodhpur, pali encapsulates the rich heritage of the region in a smattering of beautiful jain temples and historical monuments. tourists can visit the well-manicured lakhotia gardens, which are surrounded by the tranquil lakhotia lake. the gardens set along the lakeside make for an excellent view during daytime, not to mention, a great viewing point for the multi-coloured sunsets of jodhpur.
a famous temple, parshuram mahadev temple that is dedicated to lord parshuram also draws visitors. it is situated amongst the aravalli mountain ranges and offers tourists adventurous and scenic opportunities. bangur museum and jawai dam are worth a visit too. the latter is built over river jawai, a tributary of river luni. while you're here, make a stop at jawai dam crocodile sanctuary, home to several crocodiles, migratory birds, and various species of mammals like leopards. one can often observe the crocodiles basking in the mid-day sun on the banks of the dam, allowing you enough time for a lengthy photo op.
