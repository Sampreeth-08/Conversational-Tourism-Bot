vadodara was originally called vadapradaka, meaning a village amidst banyan trees. that human habitation reached here during the prehistoric times is evident from the archaeological findings. the city has been under the patronage of  imperial guptas, chalukyas, rashtrakutas, solankis, delhi sultans, mughals and marathas, all of whom bestowed upon it architectural riches. the credit for the present-day city can be attributed to social-reformer, art-architecture-music patron maharaja sayajirao gaekwad iii. vadodara is popularly recognised as the cultural capital of gujarat and is believed to be the third-largest city in the state.
