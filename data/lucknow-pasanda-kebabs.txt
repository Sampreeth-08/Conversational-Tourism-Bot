pasanda kebabs
pasanda kebabs derive their name from the urdu word 'pasande', meaning favourite, as they include the prime cuts of meat in their preparation. a dish served to mughal emperors, it is usually prepared as curry, with large pieces of marinated lamb cooked in a spicy gravy. today, several restaurants and joints also serve it as a kebab concoction.
two-inch square boneless kebabs are made from thin layers of mutton that are marinated in raw papaya, white pepper power and a generous dollop of ginger garlic paste. these kebabs are barbecued on a coal fire grill, and are best savoured with chaat masala, which gives the dish a heavenly flavour. there are two main methods of preparationâ€“ the mutton pieces can either be skewered or cooked. the majority of the chefs in lucknow prefer the latter.
