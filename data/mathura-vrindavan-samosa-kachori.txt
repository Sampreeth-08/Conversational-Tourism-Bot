in mathura, breakfast isn’t just the first meal of the day – it is a time spent with family, catching up on stories with friends, and preparing for the day over a hot cup of tea. and of course, tea is only savoured as it is meant to be when accompanied by hot samosa and yummy kachori. for both these street snacks, pastry dough is filled with spicy ingredients and deep-fried. the crispy delicacies are triangular (samosa) and round (kachori) in shape. they are served with spicy mint or sweet and sour tamarind chutney. in mathura, these snacks are available at hole-in-the-wall stalls as well as restaurants across town.
