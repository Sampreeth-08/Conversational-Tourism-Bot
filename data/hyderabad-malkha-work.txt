malkha work
malkha is a handwoven cotton fabric, which is coloured with natural dyes. it is used to make sarees, tablecloths, dupattas and bedspreads and can be bought at local handicraft stores across the city.the story of the evolution of malkha is an inspiring one. before the industrial revolution, the cotton industry was one of the major threads in the fabric of indian society. it was booming and had been flourishing since millennia. however, after the revolution, the focus shifted to making as much cotton as possible and as cheaply as could be. thus, big and looming machines took over artisans who drew their livelihood from this craft. moreover, making cotton this way also polluted the earth, sky and water.thus, malkha came as a restoration of the earlier handloom. it combines natural dyes with the thousand-year-old cotton-making skill of indians with innovative engineering.during the manufacturing process of malkha, bigger units are replaced by smaller units i.e. local skill and raw materials are used and spinning is made a viable occupation, sidelining the machines. thus, farmers, weavers and spinners all benefit from this industry.
