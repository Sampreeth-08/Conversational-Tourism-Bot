chikki
groundnuts and jaggery are combined to make this delicious sweet snack that is enjoyed by one and all. it has many variants where, instead of groundnut, the makers use sesame, khobara (desiccated coconut) and even chana (gram). the name of every chikki variety comes from the ingredients used in the making.
