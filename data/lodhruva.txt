lodhruva 
situated on the outskirts of jaisalmer, the deserted ruins of lodhruva, are famous for a jain temple and a wishing tree called kalp vriksh. the temple is dedicated to the 23rd tirthankar (saint), parshwanath. the architectural beauty of the temple can be seen on each finely carved stone that was used to construct it. the intricate stone carvings and large, spacious interiors make for a pleasant and relaxing time at the complex, which has been reinstated to it's pristine condition after extensive repairs and restorative work carried out over the years. lodhruva is said to be the setting of the doomed-love story of princess mumal and mahendra, the prince of aamarkot, recounted in local folklore and songs across the region. ludruva is known as the ancient capital of jaisalmer.
