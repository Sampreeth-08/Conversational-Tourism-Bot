junagadh 
somnath-temple 
dedicated to lord shiva, the somnath temple is one of the most important spiritual sites in the hindu circuit. believed to be the first of the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of lord shiva) in the country, the temple sees a large footfall every year. skirted by the arabian sea, the temple commands a spectacular view of the saurashtra peninsula. boasting an imposing architecture of the chalukyan style, the somnath temple with its striking shikhara (spire) is 50 m tall. silver doors, intricate carvings, a shivling and a nandi idol (bull god) add to the splendour of the building. the huge courtyard of the temple has an equally large mandapa (hall) and the main shrine, whose arches tower over the whole temple complex. after paying obeisance, devotees can slip through a side door to find an ethereal view of sunlight tripping over the sea waves. 
 
located about 94 km from junagadh, the somnath temple is said to have been originally built by the moon god with gold. later, it was razed to the ground and rebuilt by ravana with silver. later, lord krishna made it in wood and then an edifice of stone was erected by one of the pandava brothers, bhima. in the month of november, the kartik purnima fair organised here attracts a large number of pilgrims.
