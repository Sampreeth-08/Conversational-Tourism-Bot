dhuandhar waterfalls
river narmada falling from a majestic height of 98 ft forms the dhuandhar waterfalls. the word ‘dhuan’ translates into smoke and the river falls on rocks with such force and from such a height that the mist created is almost like a smokescreen. the view is surreal and the experience unforgettable. there are marble rocks nearby and boating facilities are also available for those who wish to soak in the mist of the waterfall. the falls can be enjoyed from bedhaghat side from where one can avail the beautiful view of the river flowing through the marble rocks. a trip to the falls can be combined with a visit to the narmada mahotsav.
