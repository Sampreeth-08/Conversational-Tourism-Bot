river cruises
panaji is located on the banks of river mandovi, and plenty of entertaining river cruises â€“ of varied durations - can be experienced with the state capital as your base. all cruises begin their tours from the santa monica jetty near mandovi bridge. the goa tourism development corporation (gtdc) operates hour-long cruises, which offer live performances of goan folk songs and dances by local artistes. these are usually aboard the santa monica or shantadurga boats.
on some days of the week, two-hour-long dinner cruises are also on offer along with a backwater cruise that takes you past the adil shah fort, a series of colonial structures and the promenade festooned with fairy lights, to miramar beach before returning to santa monica jetty.
