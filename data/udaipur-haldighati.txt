haldighati
a picturesque mountain pass, around an hour away from udaipur, haldighti is famous for several wars that were fought here, the most legendary being the battle of 1576, between rana pratap singh of mewar and mughal emperor akbar's army. it is said so many soldiers died in this batle that the yellow coloured soil (from which the place derives its name) turned red.
it is also the place where the gallant chetak, the beloved horse of maharana pratap, lost his life while trying to save the king. there is a cenotaph built in pure white marble, dedicated to chetak. about 40 km from udaipur, today haldighati is a place where legends come to life. nearby is badshahi bagh, famous for gulkand, a sweet jam-like preparation made from rose petals.
