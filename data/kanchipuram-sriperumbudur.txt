sriperumbudur
famous for the ramanuja swamy temple, which is also known as the adikesava temple, sriperumbudur lies on the outskirts of kanchipuram. this must-visit temple has three images of saint ramanuja that were made during the saintâ€™s lifetime in srirangam, his birthplace of sriperumbudur and melkote, in the neighbouring state of karnataka.
in front of the shrine of sri ramanuja lies a resplendent golden mandap, which was built by the erstwhile maharaja of mysore. four kalasas, representing the four vedas, have been built on this mandap. there are several idols that sit on the mandap, under the kalasas, which is why the mandap looks like a temple itself.
