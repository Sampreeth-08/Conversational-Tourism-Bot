patnitop
description
surrounded by the majestic, snow-clad mountains of the pir panjal range, lush greenery and colourful fields, patnitop, in jammu and kashmir, makes for a lovely getaway. it sits atop a plateau in the shivalik belt and remains shrouded by a thick canopy of green pines and dense woods. cut by the pristine chenab river, patnitop has mesmerising natural charms that leave you awed. it has a number of verdant valleys and vast, empty fields that are now being dedicated to camps, making camping one of the most coveted activities here. travellers looking to engage their adventurous side can go trekking and hiking as well.
there is a charming legend associated with patnitop. it is believed that a pond existed amidst the lush green pastures of the area, and the princess of the ruling kingdom used to bathe in it every day. thus, the pond that was called 'patan da talab', or the pond of the princess, greatly influenced the name of the place. the hill station is also home to three freshwater springs whose cold water is believed to harbour medicinal properties.
lying on the outskirts of patnitop are the towns of kud and batote. kud is popular for patissa, also known as soan papdi, while batote is known for its high-quality kidney beans, known as rajma in hindi. situated almost 112 km from jammu and 47 km from udhampur, the hill station of patnitop falls in the udhampur district of jammu and kashmir.
