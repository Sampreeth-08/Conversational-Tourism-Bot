bharat mandir
near triveni ghat lies the bharat mandir, which is said to be the oldest temple in rishikesh. it is said that it was built by sage adi shankaracharya on the day of basant panchami (festival to celebrate the arrival of spring) in 789 ad. the presiding deity of the temple is lord vishnu, whose idol has been carved out of a single black stone. popularly called saligram, the idol has been placed in the inner chambers of the temple. on the day of basant panchami, the saligram is taken out for a holy bath in the sacred mayakund, a small pond nearby. it is then carried in a grand procession through the city and later re-installed in the temple. opposite to the temple is an old tree, which is a combination of three different trees, whose roots are entwined with each other, making it impossible to distinguish one from the other. these are the old banyan, peepal and bel trees. many believe that these trees represent the holy trinity of hinduism.
lord brahma, lord vishnu, lord shiva. another attraction is a broken buddha statue, obtained during excavations, which has been kept under the tree. it is believed to date back to the ashoka period.
