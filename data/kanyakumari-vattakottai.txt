this 18th-century seaside circular fort is made of granite blocks. many years ago, when the area was quite clear, observers could see up to the padmanabhapuram palace from here. a 4-ft-wide and 25-km-long tunnel is said to have once existed between the fort and the palace. the architecture additions of the fort are reminiscent of the rule of the pandyas (4th to 16th century), especially the fish motifs engraved on the walls. overlooking the arabian sea on one side and the bay of bengal on the other, is the raised parade ground. sometime back, the archaeology department also conducted a renovation exercise here. one of the most interesting features is a beach of black sand near the fort as well as a small river that joins the sea on one side of the fort.
