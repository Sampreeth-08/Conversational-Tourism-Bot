jalebi
the dessert dish is made from refined flour, yoghurt, sugar, milk powder and saffron, and then it is deep-fried in ghee (clarified butter). to relish the crispiness, it is eaten hot. it is a favourite breakfast snack, typically paired with tea. in mathura, a specialty known as “aloo ki jalebi” is relished by those attempting the parikrama of govardhan. this particular version tastes like potatoes, and is just perfect for tired devotees to give them a boost of energy.
