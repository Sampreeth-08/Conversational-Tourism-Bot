hampi 
hemakuta-hill-temple 
on the southern side of hampi stands the hemakuta hill, its gentle slopes dotted with a large number of temples, archways and pavilions. it is said that the hill was once fortified with stone walls, the ruins of which can still be seen. once you have reached the top (a 15-minute-climb), it flattens out like a small plateau. it is said that this is the place where the marriage of lord shiva and goddess pampa was finalised. mythology says, skies rained gold (known as hema in sanskrit, thus the name of the hill) at that time. there are several temples dedicated to lord shiva here, which have mesmerising structures that draw admiration from visitors. they are mostly triple-chambered, with pyramid-like roofs made of granite. they are quite different from the vijayanagara architectural style prominent in this region and thus have often been confused with jain temples. 
hemakuta hill is also one of the best places in hampi to enjoy fantastic views of the sunrise and the sunset.
