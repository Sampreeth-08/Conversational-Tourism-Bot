siddhavat
bestowed with the same religious sanctity as vanshivat in vrindavan and akshayvat in gaya, siddhavat is a huge banyan tree on the banks of river kshipra. pegged as a paap-mochan (sin purifier) teerth, the tree is believed to have been planted by goddess parvati when she had come to worship and perform penance. saints of the nath cult throng this place all-year-round to worship and meditate. there is a restaurant in the vicinity for pilgrims and travellers to relax in. devotees also take a holy dip in the sacred kshipra river. this is believed to wash away their sins. the temple opens as early as 4 am and a lot of visitors come here on sarvapitra amavashya to pray for the peace of the departed souls.
