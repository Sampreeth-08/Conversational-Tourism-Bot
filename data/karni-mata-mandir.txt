karni-mata-mandir 
famed as the rat temple, karni mata mandir draws devotees and tourists from far and wide. the much revered temple is dedicated to goddess karni mata, who is believed to be an incarnation of goddess durga. the temple houses as many as 25,000 rats who are known as kaabas. it is considered highly auspicious to have a white kaaba run across your feet as they are believed to be the sons of karni mata. around 600 families of the charan clan claim to be the descendents of karni mata and believe that they will be reincarnated as rats. karni mata is also the kul devi of bikaner's royal family. she lived in the 14th century and performed many miracles. one of the popular legends associated with the temple is that when laxmana, the stepson of karni mata drowned in the kapil sarovar while attempting to drink water, karni mata prayed to yama raj ( the god of death ) so ardently that he not only brought back laxmana to life but reincarnated all her sons in the form of rats. it's interesting to note that these rats don't spread any kind of stink like rats usually do and they have never been the cause for spreading any disease either. eating food that has been nibbled on by the rats, is in fact considered auspicious. in front of the temple is a beautiful marble facade, which has solid silver doors. the building was completed in its current form in the early 20th century by maharaja ganga singh of bikaner. don't forget to make a wish in the lion's ears at the main gate before you leave the temple complex. tourists can also visit the recently built karni mata panorama located on the way back to bikaner from deshnok. the museum depicts the stories of karni mata through beautiful sculptures, paintings and tableaus.
