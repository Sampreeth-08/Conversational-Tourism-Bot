basukinath-temple 
basukinath temple is believed to be the court of baba bhole nath. temples of lord shiva and goddess parvati have been erected here, facing each other. during the opening of the gates, devotees are asked to move away from the gates, as it is believed that lord shiva and goddess parvati meet each other at this time. basukinath is one of the oldest temples in the region and is located near the village of jarmundi. the best time to visit this temple is during the shravana (a month in the hindu calendar) mela (fair), between july and august. the place is crowded with devotees during this time. saffron-clad pilgrims can be seen everywhere and the fair is a good time to soak in some spiritual vibes.
