kumbalgarh 
mammadev-temple 
built by rana kumbha, the ruler of mewar, in 1460, the mammadev temple is located below the kumbhalgarh fort. originally, the shrine had four slabs and one could see the history of the kingdom of mewar etched on one of the slabs. the inscription traces the history from the period of guhil, who was the founder of mewar, to the reign of rana kumbha, a great builder of forts and temples. the slabs are now well-persevered in the museum of udaipur, 102 km away from kumbhalgarh. the temple also houses an idol of lord kuber, the god of wealth, and two cenotaphs that were built in the memory of rana kumbha and prithviraj chauhan. a beautiful reservoir or kund located near the temple is also worth a visit.
