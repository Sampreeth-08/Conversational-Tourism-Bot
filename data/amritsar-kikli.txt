kikli
a folk dance form of punjab, kikli involves the participation of  two or more young girls, who hold hands and spin on their toes. it is more of a sport than a dance and the girls spin around with colourful and vibrant ‘orhins’ or ‘duppattas’ tied to their heads. the tinkling of the anklets that they wear adds melody to the dance.
