bankura horses
one of the most prestigious art forms of west bengal, bankura horses are used for both religious and decorative purposes. they are a fine example of terracotta craftsmanship and are distinguished by an erect neck and pointed ears. these horses are generally six inches to four feet in height and feature wide jaws. you can shop for these articles in bishnupur, nakaijuri, kamardiha and biboda, in west bengal. the process of making bankura horses is an intricate one. bamboo and stone tools are used to carve out the body parts - four legs, a long neck, face, ears, tail etc. some of the parts are made separately and then attached to the main body with clay paste. the body is smoothened to give it a neat finish. after this, the products are sun dried, coloured and burnt in kiln. bankura horses have been used in worshipping and religious ceremonies since ancient times in the state of bengal. the potters of panchmura, about 16 miles from bishnupur, are believed to have crafted these horses first. they are used in the chariot of lord dharamaraj, who is worshipped as a form of sun god. this is why many people consider it holy to keep the horses in their homes.
