jaswant thada
jaswant thada is a 19th century royal cenotaph located to the left of the mehrangarh fort complex. it was built by maharaja sardar singh to commemorate his father maharaja jaswant singh ii, the 33rd rathore ruler of jodhpur. a beau ideal of architectural excellence, it is a white marble memorial built out of intricately carved sheets of marble; in fact, the faade seems to shine when hit by sunlight.
