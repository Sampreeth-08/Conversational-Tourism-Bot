khuda baksh oriental public library
the gorgeous khuda baksh oriental public library is located on the banks of river ganges, next to the bustling ashok rajpath. it is a national library that was opened to the public in 1891. the beauty of its exhibits is that they are one man's collection â€“ assimilated by mohammad baksh and then added to by his son khuda baksh. mohammad baksh gave a collection of 1,400 manuscripts to his son, who turned them into a passion.
a special person was hired by khuda baksh to travel to arab countries to source manuscripts that could be added to this collection. in 1888, he got a two-storey building constructed for 4,000 manuscripts and opened it to the general public. today, the library is visited by scholars from across the globe in search of research material.
