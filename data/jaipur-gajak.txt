gajak
gajak is a simple yet delicious sweet dish. a thin and flaky bite-sized sweet, it is made with nutritious sesame seeds, groundnuts and jaggery, and resembles the popular chikki. this crunchy treat gives a great start to the morning and keeps one warm during winter months.Â legend has it that gajak originated in morena in madhya pradesh. to make it, the dough is hammered until sesame seeds break down and release the oil. many believe that gajak came into being during the mughal era. since the mughals ate meat, their protein requirements could be met easily. however, the hindu kings had to resort to vegetarian sources of protein. thus, chana (chickpea), jaggery, peanuts and sesame seeds were mixed to provide the required energy.
