orchha
spiritual
chaturbhuj temple
this beautiful temple dominates the town of orchha with its shikharas (spires) soaring into the sky. built on a 4.5-m-high platform, a flight of stairs leads to the main temple. it is said that this is where an idol of lord rama was originally supposed to be enshrined. failing to do so, king madhukar, who was the then ruler of orchha, decided to place an idol of lord vishnu here. the word 'chaturbhuj' literally means one who has four arms, and refers to lord rama, who is believed to be an incarnation of lord vishnu.
