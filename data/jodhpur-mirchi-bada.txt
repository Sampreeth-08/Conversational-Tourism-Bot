mirchi bada
mirchi bada is a popular jodhpuri street food. it is prepared with thick and less spicy green chillies that are stuffed with a little spicy-tangy potato stuffing, and dipped in gram flour batter, then deep fried until golden and crispy. it tastes best when served with zingy coriander chutney or tomato sauce, and pairs well with another street food, mawa kachori.
during monsoon season, when the temperatures dip and a cool breeze flows through town, a hot cup of tea accompanied by a plate of steaming mirchi bada is unbeatable, with the locals thronging the stalls and shops selling this delicacy. now, it has made its way to other parts of the country, known in south india as menasinakayi (chilli) bajji, and mirch pakora in north india.
