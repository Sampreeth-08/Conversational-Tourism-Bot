mathura-vrindavan 
rath-yatra 
also known as brahmotsava, this ten-day festival is observed every year in the month of march-april, in celebration of lord krishna arriving in braj. in mythology, the yatra pays tribute to suryanarayana (the sun god) avatar of lord jagannatha. it is believed that during this time, lord jagannatha, his sister goddess subhadra and brother lord balaram descend from their heavenly abode to bless their devotees. rath yatra is one of the best ways to witness the devotion of mathura to its resident deity, while also sampling some its most delicious food. devotees are seen pulling the rath, or chariot from temples to the adjoining gardens. these chariots have idols of lord vishnu along with his mythical vehicle garuda, lord hanuman, lord surya, lord chandra (moon god), an elephant and a lion, all of which are beautifully decorated. their arrival is preceded by the sudarshan chakra (divine weapon) of lord krishna, which is brought from bhagavata bhawan. in mathura, the procession starts from the birthplace of lord krishna, while in vrindavan, it begins from three different temples at the same time. it moves past deeg gate, mandi ramdas, chowk bazar, swami ghat, chatta bazar, holi gate, kotwali gate, and bharatpur gate, finally concluding back at krishnaâ€™s birthplace. flowers are showered on the idols, as prasad is distributed to the devotees, followed by a grand feast.
