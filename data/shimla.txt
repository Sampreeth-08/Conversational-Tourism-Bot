shimla
description
enveloped in mist, nestled within dense forests and silhouetted against snowy peaks of the mighty himalayas, shimla is a paradise in the hills. from its british-era lodges that take you back to the old-world to the bustling 12-km-long ridge, the heartbeat of the city, shimla, in himachal pradesh, is among the most popular hill stations in india. ringed by seven lofty hills, shimla is an ideal summer holiday destination and equally popular in winter, when a blanket of snow covers it. an ideal getaway to experience thrilling and adrenaline-pumping sports like skiing, trekking, paragliding and ice skating,
shimla has one of the oldest golf courses in the country. almost perfectly preserving its legacy, as the erstwhile summer capital of the british in india, shimla is dotted with sprawling colonial bungalows and is also renowned as the official retreat of the president of india.
it is said that attracted by the pleasant weather of the city, many europeans flocked to this city, building houses for themselves in order to escape the summer heat of the plains. they brought with them their cuisine and their culture of parties, balls, games of golf and elite clubs. later, the hill station attracted filmmakers, who were charmed by its gorgeous landscapes.
