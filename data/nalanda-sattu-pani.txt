sattu pani
sattu pani or sattu sharbat is a savoury drink from bihar, which is loved in almost all parts of the country. sattu is flour made from ground pulses and cereals like black chana. sattu pani can be both sweet and salty, depending on your choice. to make it sweeter, sattu powder is mixed with water and sugar. the salty version is made by mixing cumin seeds, coriander leaves, green chillies and black salt to the sattu powder along with water. it also acts as a great cooler during the summer season.
