breeches
jodhpuris or breeches are pants worn primarily for horse riding. these churidar pants are flared at the top and tapered at the bottom. as with most fashion, jodhpuris have evolved over time, with the baggy fit becoming tightened, along with a few other subtle alterations.
however, one thing that has stayed constant in the style and design of this outerwear is comfort. breeches are designed keeping in mind the long and grueling hours riders have to spend on horseback, and are thus created to allow for maximum mobility, as well as heavy-duty use. they dont tear or lose vibrancy easily. sometimes, an additional strip of cloth is placed above the knee to further enhance movement. a patch of grip material is placed on the seat of the breeches to help the rider stay seated.
