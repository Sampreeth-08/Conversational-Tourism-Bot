katarmal is home to one of the most important sun temples in the northern state of uttarakhand, called the katarmal surya temple. the temple stands in a picturesque location near the bridge of the kosi river. it was built by a katyuri king called katarmalla in the 9th century ad. the deity to whom the temple is dedicated here is the old sun god known as burhaditya or vraddhaditya. sculptures of shiva-parvati and laxmi-narayan have been established in the premises. the temple has a remarkably unique architecture, which includes carved pillars and doors along with intricate stone and metallic sculptures. as can be expected, the temple faces east so that the first rays of the sun fall on the shivling. the main temple is an older structure that is surrounded by 45 smaller shrines. to reach it, one has to trek almost 3 km, crossing hawalbagh and matela near kosi river. the doors of the temple have now been moved to the national museum in delhi. the temple is also called bara aditya temple. lying at an elevation of about 2,116 m above sea level, it is 17 km from almora.
