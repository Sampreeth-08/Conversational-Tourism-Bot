aparwath peak
at 14,500 ft, the apharwat peak is a famous tourist attraction located approximately 13 km away from gulmarg. it is said that the snow here is soft and as clear as crystal. since it receives such heavy snowfall, it remains covered with snow almost throughout the year. thus, it makes an ideal location for skiing. a ride in the cable car, called gondola, is a must-try. in a dreamy ride, it transports visitors from gulmarg to kongdoor and from kongdoor to apharwat. one can book the tickets for the ride online or at the location. reaching here, however, is a matter of luck as it is highly dependent on the weather conditions, which tend to be tough through most of the year. once you reach the peak, you will be greeted by chilly winds. human sledges are available to take you higher up on the peak if you so wish. the loc (line of control) lies just a few kilometres away from the aphrawath peak.
