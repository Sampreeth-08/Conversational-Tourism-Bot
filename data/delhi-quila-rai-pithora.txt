quila rai pithora
a historical gem in delhi, qila rai pithora or lal kot was built by rajput king prithvi raj chauhan, who was fondly called rai pithora. the ruins of the vast fort bear traces of its former grandeur, and can be seen around areas of qutub minar, saket, vasant kunj, mehrauli and kishangarh. earlier, qila rai pithora was a city surrounded by fortifications.
it is said to be an extension of lal kot, which was the first city of delhi, built in the 8th century by tomar kings. it is said that the fort came under the rule of mamluk dynasty, when prithvi raj chauhan was defeated by qutb al-din aibak. since then, the fort has had the same structure with no renovations. today, it falls under the archaeological survey of india (asi) and makes for an interesting exploration.
