vishvamitra-ka-tila 
vishvamitra ka tila is home to the remains of an ancient vishnu temple. it is situated on the southern bank of now unexisting river sarawati, on the outskirts of the town of pehowa. the site is archaeologically important because of two inscriptions from the gurjar-pratihara period (8th to 11th century) that have been found here. one of the inscription details the creation of the three vishnu temples in the town. the other inscription, in the garibnath mutth, dates back to 882 ad and records raja bhojdeva's collection of voluntary tax for the maintenance of the vishnu temples in the area from the traders. excavations in the area have yielded intricate stone sculptures, depicting scenes from the ramayana and the mahabharata. another important excavation revealed the remains of an ancient temple plinth made of baked bricks. the remains are important because they are the only known brick temple remains of their kind in this region.
