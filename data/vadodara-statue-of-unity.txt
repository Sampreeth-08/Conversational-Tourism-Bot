statue of unity
it’s huge, almost gigantic! that is the first reaction most people have as they speed down the winding road leading to the towering statue of unity (sou). a long bridge connects the mainland to the sadhu bet island, on which the statue stands. silhouetted against the surrounding vindhya and satpura mountain ranges, the colossal statue almost seems to pierce the skyline.
the legacy of sardar vallabhbhai patel, india’s iron man, lives on in the form of this massive statue dominating the narmada river basin. he towers over the landscape, as if, keeping an eye over the land he helped become independent. standing at a height of 182 m, the statue of unity, is the tallest in the world. it depicts sardar patel in a walking pose, clad in his characteristic simple attire. about 100 times the height of a five-and-a-half-ft-tall person, one can see the statue from as far away as 8 km. the sou was inaugurated on october 31, 2018, by prime minister narendra modi to commemorate patel’s 143rd birth anniversary.
