rishikesh 
ram-jhula 
an iconic landmark in rishikesh, ram jhula, built in 1986, is a suspension bridge that runs across the ganges. it is placed a few miles downstream from the popular lakshman jhula. the bridge spans 750 ft and is a splendid work of engineering that connects the ashrams situated on both sides of the river. it offers a splendid bird's eye view of the mighty river making its way through gigantic mountains and dense forests. 
the bridge was constructed after lakshmana (laxman) jhula and is quite similar to it in design and steel structure. while walking across the bridge, one can enjoy the picturesque view of the surrounding mountains and feel the gentle breeze on the face. the sounds of river ganga gushing underneath add to the charm of the environment. 
there are markets on either side of the bridge selling books on religion and spirituality, incense sticks, idols of gods and goddesses and other knick-knacks. one should not forget to savour the local sweets.
