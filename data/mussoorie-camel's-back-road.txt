camel's back road
camel's back road is a 3 km stretch that gets its name from a natural cluster of rocks shaped like a camel's hump. the road connects two prominent locations--library point and kulri bazar. the slope adjacent to the road houses a colonial cemetery dating back to the mid-19th century. the road winds through rocky mountains and green woods and serves as an ideal place for tranquil nature walks. it also provides magnificent views of sunrises and sunsets.
