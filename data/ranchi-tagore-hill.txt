tagore hill
standing at a height of 300 ft, tagore hill is a prominent tourist stopover that offers surreal views of sunrises and sunsets. the beauty of the hill is such that it is said that rabindranath tagore's elder brother, jyotindranath tagore, who visited the hill in 1908, was left smitten with the scenery. soon, he set up his camp home at the hill after which it came to be known as tagore hill. tourists can also visit the ramkrishna mission ashram, located at the base of a hill, which is the centre of agrarian vocational institute and divyayan. the tagore hill can be easily reached from all parts of ranchi. it is a delight for trekkers and hikers as the hilltop offers a 360 degree view of the city.
