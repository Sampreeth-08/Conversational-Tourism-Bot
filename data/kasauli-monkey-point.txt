monkey point
the highest point in the town, monkey point is situated on a 6,500-ft-high hilltop. from here, tourists can get a picturesque view of the town and the city of chandigarh on a clear and sunny day. a temple dedicated to lord hanuman stands here, and invites devotees from all over the area. legend has it that when lord hanuman was returning with the sanjeevini booti (divine medicine) for lord lakshmana in the epic ramayana, his foot touched the hilltop of kasauli. interestingly, the hilltop is in the shape of a foot.
the area hosts a large number of monkeys who are quite friendly. as it falls under the territory of the indian air force, visitors are not permitted to carry electronic devices inside the temple complex.
