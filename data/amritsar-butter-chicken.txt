butter chicken
also known as murgh makhani, butter chicken is a delectable staple of most non-vegetarians in the country. it is made using pur√©ed tomatoes, spices and dried fenugreek leaves. dollops of butter and fresh cream, along with a pinch of sugar, give the chicken a deep and balanced flavour. the curry is best enjoyed with butter or garlic naan (traditional indian breads). it is said that the dish finds its origins at the moti mahal, darya ganj, in delhi. the story goes that in the 1950s, the place was already popular among tandoori chicken lovers. the cooks at the restaurant were in a habit of recycling the left-over chicken juices by adding butter and tomato to them. once, this sauce was tossed with pieces of tandoori chicken by accident. thus, was born the decadent butter chicken that sets mouths drooling all over the world. it is creamy with thick, red tomato gravy and tastes slightly sweet. the dish almost melts in the mouth as the juice percolates into the chicken pieces making them juicy and tender.
