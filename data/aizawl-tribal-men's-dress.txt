tribal men's dress
mizo men lead simple lives that is evident from the way they dress. a single piece of cloth, 7-ft-long and 5-ft-wide is turned into a manâ€™s dress. it is worn by holding one corner in left hand with the cloth passing over the left shoulder, behind the back and then across the chest under the right arm. the end is thrown over the left shoulder. bands of red and white in different patterns give the coat an ornamental look. during the winter season, the men wrap an extra piece of fabric around their upper body paired with a white coat. the sleeves of the coat have white and red bands. during summers, the men usually prefer a dress that can be wrapped around the waist. a turban is worn on the head to give protection from scorching heat during the summer season.
