sha phaley
originating in tibet, sha phaley comprises deep-fried bread and meat. bread stuffed with ground meat and cabbage is moulded into semi-circles to make fritters. it might seem similar to gujiya to a lot of people. while gujiya is typically vegetarian and sweet, sha phaley is crispy on the outside and oozes with succulent meat on the inside. the key to making a firm yet supple pot sticker, which is softer than a momo, is leaving the dough to rest and let it rise for an extra hour.
a lot of variations have been made to the traditional dish, including additions of cheese and tofu to the stuffing. thus, vegans too have a chance to enjoy this dish.
