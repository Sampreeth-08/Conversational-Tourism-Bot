chandigarh
description
large sweeping avenues, the serene sukhna lake, sprawling parks, spectacular contemporary buildings and the famous rock garden, make india's most well-planned city an urban paradise. the capital of the neighbouring states of punjab and haryana, chandigarh is an urban oasis with charming tree-lined boulevards and beautifully landscaped gardens.Â envisioned and designed in the 1950s by the prominent french-swiss architect, le corbusier, the major buildings of the city are marvels of modern design. the city is neatly divided into sectors, each a self-contained pocket with local markets, schools, parks and other infrastructural facilities. merely 70 years old, chandigarh is a young, prosperous and vibrant city. it is extremely pedestrian-friendly and most visitors to the city begin by exploring sector 17 for its shops and restaurants and sector 22 for its hotels. what makes chandigarh a great travel destination is its geographical location at the foothills of the majestic shivalik range and the himalayas, and its pleasant climate.
the region is also famous because of the fossil remains that have been found here, indicating a wide variety of aquatic and amphibian life. before civilisation arrived here, it is said this region was submerged under a large lake ringed by a marshy area.
