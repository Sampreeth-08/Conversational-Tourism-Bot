masrur-temple 
the masrur rock-cut temples are not only spiritually significant but also an important archaeological site. they are a group of 15 monolithic rock-cut temples made in indo-aryan style. though a major part of them is in ruins, one can study the relics with ease. it is believed that the temple was built between 8th and 9th centuries. the main shrine houses the idols of lord rama, goddess sita and lord lakshamana. legend has it that the pandavas of the epic mahabharata spent a long time in this temple during their exile. the temple also has an incomplete staircase and many believe that it was built by the pandavas to reach heaven. however, when they were building it, lord indra (king of gods) worried that they would succeed and reach heaven, disrupted their work. thus, the staircase could not be completed.
