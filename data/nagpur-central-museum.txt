central museum
boasting a unique collection of antiquities, coins, ancient inscriptions, sculptures, inscriptions and prehistoric artefacts, central museum is an important tourist site. some of these exhibits are said to be dating back to the indus valley civilisation. the museum is locally known as 'ajab bangla' and is a hidden treasure for tourists coming from different parts of the country. established in 1862 by sir richard temple, the then chief commissioner of nagpur, the museum has a rich well-stocked library and an art gallery that has unique paintings from the bombay school of art. an interesting aspect of the museum is the gallery of natural history that houses trophies of antlers, fish, reptiles and invertebrates. notable exhibits of the great indian bustard and white crow are particularly interesting.
