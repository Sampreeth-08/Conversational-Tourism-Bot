kartikeya-temple 
an important site that is immersed in mahabharata lore is the kartikeya temple. it is believed to have been built around 5th century bc. one among the many pilgrimage temples in the pehowa region, this temple is dedicated to the hindu god kartikeya, son of lord shiva and goddess parvati. local legend has it that lord krishna instructed prince yudhishthira to light two lamps in honour of the 18 lakh warriors, who had lost their lives in the battle of kurukshetra. it is believed that the two lamps that flank the temple are the same and they have been glowing continuously. since this temple celebrates the brahmachari or the bachelor state of lord kartikeya, there is a strict rule that forbids women to enter the temple. this temple is located on the outskirts of the city.
