amber fort
just 11 km outside jaipur, lies the magnificent amber fort (amer fort), sitting atop a hill, and rising like a sentinel guarding the city. commissioned in 1592 by maharaja man singh i, the fort is a fine blend of rajput and mughal architectural styles, and boasts a grand palace, temples and several ornate gates. built entirely of red sandstone with white marble work, the unesco world heritage site is a picture of opulence and grandeur, set against a stark desert backdrop and rolling hills.
