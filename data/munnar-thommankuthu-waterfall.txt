thommankuthu waterfall
thommankuthu lies 18 km away from the town of thodupuzha and is an ideal picnic spot. the waterfall here gets its name from the tribal leader kolumban, who was washed away in its waters. you can go up to the top of the mountain and opt for night camping and birdwatching while enjoying the views after a 12 km trek, but trekkers are recommended to have a guide accompany them, because the trail is winding and they could get lost. the waterfall is at a height of 1,500 m and cascades down seven steps with a pool at each tier. visitors can go boating and fishing as well. travellers might need to contact the district tourism promotion council of idukki or the divisional forest office of the state department of forests and wildlife before visiting this site.
