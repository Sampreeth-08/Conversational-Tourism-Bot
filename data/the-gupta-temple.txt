the-gupta-temple 
the origin of the gupta temple can be dated back to the 5th century ad. the temple was built during the reign of the gupta dynasty, whose rule is referred to as the golden age due to the remarkable progress made during it. its entrance is flanked by massive pillars that represent one of the earliest known examples of temple architecture in india. 
this was the time of the highest glory for the gupta dynasty and one can see it clearly reflected in the temple. it stands as a testament to the period when architectural investment was being made in sanchi again after the time of the mauryan empire. though the temple is not embellished much, it manages to carve out a niche for itself with its simplicity.
