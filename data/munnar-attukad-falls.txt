attukad falls
about 9 km away from munnar and before the town of pallivasal lies attukad. here, the landscape is covered with rocky hills and small waterfalls. refresh yourself with cool and blue waters of the falls and leave your worries behind as you stroll along the sprawling greens. the best time to visit the waterfalls is in the monsoon season, when rainwater replenishes the falls, with water gushing into the pool below with great speed and force. it makes for a mesmerising site and is a favourite among photographers. the rock face contrasting with the trees that seem to grow out of the rock itself, makes for a very dramatic landscape.
