iskcon-temple 
sri sri krishna balaram mandir, dedicated to brothers lord krishna and lord balaram, is located in the raman reti area of vrindavan. it was built in 1975 by bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada, the founder acharya of the international society of krishna consciousness (iskcon); it was his dream to create a temple dedicated to the brothers in the same place they played thousands of years ago. so important was this temple to him, he personally oversaw its construction and design, and prayed to balaram, the god of spiritual strength, to bless his devotees. 
a grand white marble archway greets visitors, who then enter the palace-like prayer hall through the huge wooden doors of the temple. intricately carved walls and winding staircases make up the main building. goddess radha and lord krishna are on the right side of the temple with gopis, lalita and vishakha. the tomb of swami prabhupada (1896-1977) is also a part of the temple. 
sri sri krishna balaram mandir is frequented by foreigners for various courses and seminars annually. you can also visit several book stalls that dot the complex, as well as a bakery, a restaurant, a broadcast studio, and a residential brahmachari ashram etc. 
while this particular iskcon temple is extraordinarily popular given its establishment in the very land where lord krishna was born, there are several other temples of the society spread across
