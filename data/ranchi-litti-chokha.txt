litti chokha
a trip to ranchi would be incomplete without relishing the freshly cooked litti chokha, the trademark dish of bihar and jharkhand. one of the most popular food items of the state, litti (dough ball made of whole wheat flour and stuffed with sattu [roasted chickpea flour]) is eaten with chokha (roasted and mashed vegetables), aloo bharta, papad and yoghurt.
