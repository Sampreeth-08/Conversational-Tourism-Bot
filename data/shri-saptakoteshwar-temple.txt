shri-saptakoteshwar-temple 
about 35 km from panaji, in the village of narve, lies the shri saptakoteshwar temple. it is considered as one of the six temples of lord shiva in the konkan region. an ancient structure, the temple is thronged by devotees of saptakoteshwar, the deity of the kadamba dynasty. a number of coins unearthed here mention the deity's name along with that of king jayeshi of kadamba dynasty. 
the most important festival celebrated here is gokulashtami, which is believed to be the day on which lord shiva appeared in this particular incarnation to answer the prayers of seven pious sages. legend behind the name saptakoteshwar is that seven holy sages started praying to lord shiva near the region where five holy rivers merged with the sea. for seven crore years, they kept praying and when lord shiva appeared to grant wishes, he promised to stay back in one of his incarnations, sapkoteshwar (sapt meaning seven and koteshwar meaning lord of crores).
