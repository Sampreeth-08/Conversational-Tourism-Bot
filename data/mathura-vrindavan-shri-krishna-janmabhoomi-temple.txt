shri krishna janmabhoomi temple
the main pilgrimage spot in mathura is krishna janmabhoomi temple, which is said to have been built around the prison cell where lord krishna was born. it is considered the focal point of the famed legends of lord krishna. one of these legends stipulates that the temple was built by vajranabha, krishnaâ€™s great grandson. believed to have been constructed in the 6th century bc, it is one of the most important sites for the devotees of lord krishna, who come and stay here, sometimes for days at a time, to seek the blessings of their beloved god.
this temple has been renovated several times over the centuries, as the land saw a series of rulers. the current group of temples is the result of a major renovation project that was carried out in the 20th century, and now comprises the impressive keshavdeva temple, with the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) located at what is said to be the birthplace of lord krishna, and the bhagavata bhavan.
