pari mahal
pari mahal or the palace of fairies is a six-terraced garden that casts a shadow on the dal lake. surrounded by colourful and beautiful flowers, the garden also boasts a small spring. it is quite different from other gardens in srinagar as it does not have cascading waterfalls but a multi-terraced structure. originally, it was planned as a sufi school by the eldest son of mughal emperor shah jahan, dara shikoh. the ancient monument, located on the mountain of zabarwan, is known for the saffron that is grown here in the months of september and october.
