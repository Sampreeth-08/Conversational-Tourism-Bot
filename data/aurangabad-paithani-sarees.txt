paithani sarees
a paithani saree is a luxury in itself. it is distinguished by its feature of looking exactly the same on both sides, including the border and the pallu. this saree forms a part of the bridal trousseau in maharashtra and does not lose its shine over time, unlike other silks. the basic colours that the saree comes in are sky blue, red, yellow, green, magenta and purple, with two dominating colours: one on the saree and the other on the border and the pallu.
this craft dates back to the satvahana dynasty that ruled from the 2nd century bc to the 2nd century ad. since it originated in paithan, in aurangabad, this fine silk handloom saree derives its name from the town itself. paithani sarees rose to fame during the mughal era, especially during the time of aurangzeb. after suffering a setback during the advent of the british rule, the peshwas revived the craft in the 17th century. in fact, they settled the weavers in yeola, which is a hub for paithani today.
