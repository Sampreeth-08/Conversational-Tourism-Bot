gundruk and sinki soup
gundruk is a vegan dish made by fermenting leafy vegetables like cabbage or radish. sometimes, mustard leaves are used in its preparation. traditionally, the dish is made in an earthen pot. over the years, there has been little variation in its ingredients or cooking process.
sinki, another traditional dish, is made with radish tap roots. the chopped roots and bamboo are covered with vegetation and mud for about a month, after which they are sun-dried. sinki stays fresh for a year, because of its high level of organic acid and low ph.
