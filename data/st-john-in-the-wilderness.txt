st-john-in-the-wilderness 
nestled amongst tall coniferous and pine trees is the st john in the wilderness church, widely known for its architectural intricacies and gothic style. the beautiful polished wood of the altar railings and the brass oil lamps along with intricate stained glass windows are particularly attractive and diminish the forbidding appearance of the stone building. a huge church bell near the entrance was brought especially from england in 1915. a memorial that dominates the environs is the elaborate stone structure erected in honour of lord elgin, the british viceroy who died at dharamsala in 1863. the church was constructed in 1852 and is also the final resting place of many europeans who perished in a massive earthquake that struck chamba valley in 1905. it is usually closed but opens on sundays for the weekly mass that is still held at 10 am.
