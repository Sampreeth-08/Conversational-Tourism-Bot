metal craft
jharkhand's tentri and malhar communities are known for being experts in metal craft and creating a wide range of articles. from weapons and hunting gear to agricultural equipment and decorative items, these talented craftsmen make ethnic articles that represent the rich tribal heritage of the state. the metal artefacts are an amazing blend of style and local designs.
while precious metals like gold and silver are used to create exquisite jewellery items, iron is used to make weapons for defensive purposes. tourists visiting ranchi will find a variety of metal products in the city's handicraft emporiums which they must carry back as souvenirs from their jharkhand trip.
