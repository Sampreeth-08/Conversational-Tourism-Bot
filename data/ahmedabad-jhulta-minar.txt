jhulta minar
popularly known as shaking minarets, these unique structures have left architects and engineers dumbfounded for centuries. so far, no one has been able to explain why if one of them shakes, the other starts vibrating too even though the connecting passage between them remains stationary and free from vibrations. one of the icons of ahmedabad, each of these minarets is three storeys tall with balconies displaying intricate carvings. of the two pairs of these minarets, one is situated opposite sarangpur darwaja, and the one named malik saranhther, near the kalupur railway station area. the one near the darwaja is within the compound of the sidi bashir mosque, which was built in 1452 ad by a slave of sultan ahmed shah. these minarets, along with the central gateway, were once a part of the sidi bashir mosque. demonstrations of the minarets shaking or vibrating are no longer carried out for public. in 1753, the main building was destroyed during a war between marathas and gujarat sultanate. in an attempt to unravel the mystery behind the shaking of these minarets, an englishman tried to demolish them but could do no harm to the structure.
