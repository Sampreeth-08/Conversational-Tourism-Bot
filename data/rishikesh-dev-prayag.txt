dev prayag
scenic dev prayag is one of the panch prayags or the five sacred confluences of rivers in the himalayas. the word 'dev prayag' literally means holy confluence. here the river bhagirathi (also known as ganga) emerges from gaumukh (terminus of gangotri glacier) and river alaknanda from alkapuri glaciers, to meet and form the holy river ganges. one of the major attractions of dev prayag is the temple of raghunathji.
