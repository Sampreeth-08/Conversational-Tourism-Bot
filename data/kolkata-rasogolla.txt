rasogolla
indian cottage cheese (chhena) is mixed with semolina (suji) dough and cooked in a light sugar syrup to make this sweet dish that is popular across the country. legend has it that the origin of rosogolla can be accredited to puri in odisha, where this 700-year-old sweet was part of a worship ritual. it is said that lord jagannath offered it to his consort, goddess lakshmi, to placate her for not taking her along on the rath yatra (chariot procession).
