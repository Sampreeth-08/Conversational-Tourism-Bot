yama-yamuna-temple 
one of the oldest and the most auspicious temples in mathura, the yam-yamuna temple is located a short distance away from vishram ghat. it is believed to have been built by vajranabha, the grandson of lord krishna, around 4,900 years ago. according to hindu mythology, yama and yamuna are siblings â€“ the god of death and the goddess of the river. legend has it, goddess yamuna invited her brother on the occasion of bhai dooj. at the end of the meal, lord yam asked her what she wanted from him, as is custom on this day. having no material desires, goddess yamuna requested him for his eternal blessings, which is why even today, her ghats are illuminated on bhai dooj, and people flock to the temple to seek blessings. the temple boasts murals, but the main prayer room is quite simple, with the idols of lord yama and goddess yamuna carved out of black stone, seated with their hands raised in blessing.
