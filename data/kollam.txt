description
an ancient port city, skirting the stunning backwaters of kerala, kollam is ensconced in the southern fringes of the state. a unique blend of serenity and natural splendour, kollam is dotted with scenic waterfalls, tranquil lakes and pristine beaches that make for a splendid retreat. it is dotted with bustling markets that teem with farmers selling cashewnuts and spices. at its heart is the picturesque ashtamudi lake lined with cashew plantations, palm trees and quaint villages. kollam is fondly called the cashew capital of the world as it is home to over 600 cashew processing units. the city also acts as the southern gateway to the tranquil backwaters of alappuzha. one of the most exhilarating and enchanting experiences on the kerala backwaters is the boat trip spanning eight hours between kollam and alappuzha.
kollam was once a major trading centre with chinese, romans, arabs and later the portuguese, the british and the dutch. it has also been mentioned in the travel writings of travellers like marco polo and ibam batuta as a commercial hub. it was a popular port during the times of the romans and the phoenicians as well.
