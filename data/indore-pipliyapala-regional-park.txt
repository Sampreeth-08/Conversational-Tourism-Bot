pipliyapala regional park
also called the atal bihari vajpayee regional park, this unique park welcomes you with a glass building that has an urban aura. as you walk on neat walkways made from multi-coloured tiles dotted with palm trees, you are enveloped by the serenity of the spot. sprawling over an area of around 120 acre, the park has been developed by the indore development authority and draws visitors for its beautiful musical fountains and lush gardens. the best spots in the garden include the french gardens, the biodiversity park and an amazing artists' village. the modern park serves as a great picnic spot. the park also houses a pristine lake where you can spend quality leisure time. children would find the bhul bhulaiya or the maze in the park quite fascinating.
