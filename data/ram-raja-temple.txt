orchha 
ram-raja-temple 
resembling a palace, this is the only temple in india where lord rama is worshipped as a king. the grand peach-tinted building with domes, was once the palace of queen ganesh kumari, the wife of king madhukar shah, the ruler of orchha. it was known as rani mahal then. 
 
the queen was a devotee of lord rama and wanted his idol to be installed in her palace. with a desire to bring the deity back in the form of a boy, the queen went on a pilgrimage to ayodhya, said to be the birthplace of the lord. it is believed that lord rama was pleased with her prayers, and agreed to come to orchha with her on one condition. according to beliefs, he said that he would not move from one temple to another and would always remain in the place where she would initially house the idol. thus, the palace was later turned into a temple of the lord.
