srirangapatna
located on the outskirts of the city, srirangapatna is the island fortress of the warrior king, tipu sultan. it looks like an egg and is situated on the banks of cauvery river. srirangapatna is dotted with architectural masterpieces, a legacy of the vijayanagar and hoysala styles. the major attractions are the ranganathaswamy temple, tipu's mosque, tipu's summer palace, the wellesley bridge and the dungeons where british prisoners were once kept. legend has it that tipu sultan was killed inside the fort by the armies of the nizams of hyderabad and the british, marking the last fight of the fourth anglo-mysore war. river cauvery flowed around the perimeter of the complex on all sides, thus creating an impenetrable island fortress. on the banks of river cauvery, around 2 km from here, stands the nimishambha (goddess parvati's incarnation) temple.
