village life experience
sample the taste of the rural life of kerala as local guides take you through their village and introduce you to their unique culture and lifestyle. you can catch the sight of villages buzzing with activity, so different from the daily din of the city, and artisans involved in activities like coconut palm frond weaving, screw pine making, broom making, shell mining.
you can also try your hand at angling as you help the locals catch fish. kumarakom is one of the few places in india where the concept of responsible tourism was first successfully implemented. the village life experience (vle) initiative of the local tourism council is aimed at introducing tourists with the daily lives of the local communities and providing an alternate source of income to the locals who participate in the programme. the initiative is a part of the award-winning kumarakom responsible tourism project and makes for an unforgettable experience that one will cherish forever.
