dagshai
a picturesque hill town off the tourist map, dagshai, lying at a height of 1,734 m invites tourists for its old-world charm. one of the oldest cantonment towns in solan, it provides sweeping and breathtaking views of chandigarh and punchkula at night. during the day, visitors can see the parwanoo timber trail from here.
dagshai was founded by the east india company in 1847 by taking five villages free from maharaja bhupinder singh of patiala. the town was primarily built to house tuberculosis patients and has a british graveyard that overlooks the valley.
