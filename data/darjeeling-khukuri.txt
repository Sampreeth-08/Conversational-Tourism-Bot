khukuri
khukuri is a sharp-edged and curved knife that indicates the pride and valour the gorkha community. its origin is lost in time, but it closely resembles the kopis, a greek knife that also has a curved blade. another legend speaks of the mallas, who came to power in nepal in the 13th century. the knives used by them are on display in a museum in kathmandu and look very familiar to the khukris used today. some ancient japanese swords have proven to have some of the distinguishing features of the khukuri, but its exact history and source are still up for debate.
the khukuri is one of the primary weapons of the gorkha clan, but today it is used more for utility purposes than for combat. many people in darjeeling use it to for chopping firewood, cutting meat and vegetable and other farm and household tasks. they are easily available on the streets of darjeeling and can be a good souvenir to take back.
