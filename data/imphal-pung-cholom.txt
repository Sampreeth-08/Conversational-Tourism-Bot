pung cholom
also known as mrindanga kirtan or dhumal or drum dance, pung cholom is a famous dance style of manipur that involves dancing and playing a drum at the same time. the hand beaten drum is known as pung and was introduced by khuyoi tompok, who ruled manipur between 154 and 264 ad. the dance form is performed exclusively by men. the dancers showcase a beautiful blend of grace and acrobatics without breaking the rhythm or flow of music. the dance performance begins on a gentle note and eventually builds up to a thunderous climax. it borrows elements from traditional manipuri martial arts like thang ta and sarit sarak. nata sankirtan, an important ceremonial dance in manipuri culture, has the pung playing generously throughout.
