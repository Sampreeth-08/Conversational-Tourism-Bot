chini ka rauza
chini-ka-rauza is believed to be the first structure in india to have been embellished extensively using glazed porcelain tiles, and is regarded by many as a significant landmark in indo-persian architecture. it is the mausoleum of mughal emperor shah jahan's prime minister, afzal khan aalmi, who was also known as maula shukrullah, shirazi. the mausoleum was built in 1635 in etmadpur and is just a kilometre away from the tomb of itmad-ud-daulah. the monument is situated amid beautiful gardens, and is renowned for its blue glazed tiles. these tiles were made using porcelain, believed to have been brought from china. they were called ‘chini mitti’ (chinese clay) at the time. while some of these are partially intact on the mausoleum’s façade, the interiors are fairly well-preserved, and feature floral designs that are unique to a signature persian art style, which eventually found a home in agra
the most striking feature of the structure is said to have been the tomb, which is now in ruins. originally, it was round, very similar to the style of afghani tombs.
