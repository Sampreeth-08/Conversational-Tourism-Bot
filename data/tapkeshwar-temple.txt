tapkeshwar-temple 
this unique temple is built in a natural cave and attracts a large number of devotees of lord shiva. located merely 6.5 km from dehradun, tapkeshwar temple is built on the banks of a river. another interesting feature of this temple is that on the shivling established here, water drips from the top of a rock. this dripping has given the temple its name 'tapkeshwar', which is a literal translation of dripping. legend has it that the shivling grants the wishes of those who come to seek the god's blessings. the temple lies amidst beautiful surroundings, where visitors come to picnic and enjoy natural beauty. being a shiva temple, shivaratri is a major event here and should not be missed by devotees.
