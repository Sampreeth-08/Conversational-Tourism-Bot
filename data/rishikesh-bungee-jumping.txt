bungee jumping
the adventure hub of india, rishikesh, offers great opportunities to indulge in bungee jumping. this sport involves one falling freely from a great height. the city of rishikesh is surrounded by verdant hills and one can experience free-fall from a height, amongst these hills, to get an adrenaline rush. the city is also home to india's first fixed platform for bungee jumping that lies at mohan chutti, which is a pristine location in the shivalik range of the himalayas, a little ahead of rishikesh.
