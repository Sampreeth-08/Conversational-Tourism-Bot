bhuj 
narayan-sarovar 
the narayan sarovar is a unique pilgrimage spot located almost at the westernmost tip of india. it takes an approximately 100 km drive from bhuj across the desert land of kutch to reach this pristine lake. according to hinduism, the narayan sarovar is one of the five holy lakes of hindus. the others are mansarovar in tibet, pampa in karnataka, bindu sagar in odisha and pushkar in rajasthan. in close proximity to the lake lie temples dedicated to sri trikamraiji, lord laxminarayan, lord govardhannathji, lord dwarkanath, lord adinarayan, lord ranchodraiji, and goddess laxmiji. these were built by the wife of maharao desalji (1719-52). 
legend has it that there was once a drought during the puranic era. to end it, the sages prayed fervently, causing lord narayan, a form of lord vishnu, to appear and touch the land with his toe. this is believed to have created the lake.
