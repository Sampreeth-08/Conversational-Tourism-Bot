marayoor
visit marayoor for its natural sandalwood forests and sugarcane farms that give splendid views of nature. essentially a hamlet, marayoor lies on the outskirts of munnar. inside the marayoor forest range is muniyara, a prehistoric site with murals, relics and rock paintings from the new stone age, where one can see scores of historians and anthropologists hard at work. the 2000-year-old monuments here include burial grounds, known as dolmenoid cists, which have been under research for centuries. the dolmenoid cists comprise four stones, each placed on one corner and capped by a larger stone. the old stone relics and paintings are particularly interesting to history buffs.
