peer ki gali
the word ‘peer’ denotes a person devoted to religion. situated between the villages of poshana and heerpur along the mughal road, written records suggest that the place got its name from a saint, named sheikh ahmed karim. the locals still worship him and he is considered as a living saint. the shrine is not the grave of the peer but the place where he meditated. it is said that there are imprints of his hands on a stone slab inside. apart from this, the area is surrounded by snow-clad mountain peaks which make it a picturesque tourist destination. locals believe that the saint still comes to help those who call on him. if you are visiting here, then you can take a short detour to the scenic srinagar as well.
