among the holiest towns of tamil nadu, tiruvannamalai is a popular pilgrim site, which is believed to one of the five spots in south india, where elements of nature (fire, air, water, earth, ether) are worshipped. in this mountain-temple town, situated at the foothills of mt arunachala, lord shiva is worshipped in his fire avatar (arunachaleswara). the town is sprawled around the iconic arunachaleswarar temple, a spectacular structure boasting four huge gateways or gopurams. on full moon nights, the town sees a sea of devotees arriving to perform the 14-km walk of girivalam, around the annamalai hill. it is a mesmeric sight to see barefoot devotees gazing at the temple atop the hill and walking while chanting “om arunachala”.
