chittorgarh
description
perched on a dramatic uprise of hills, chittorgarh, in rajasthan, is the largest fort complex in india, sprawling as far as the eye can see. nestled in the aravalli range and flanked by the pristine berach river, chittorgarh echoes with the tales of rajput gallantry and the melodious tunes of saint-queen meera bai's devotional songs. the historical grandeur of the city is reflected in its majestic monuments, a legacy of the sisodia rajputs of mewar, who made the region their capital. fortified under the patronage of the rajputs, who would rather die in battle than surrender, chittorgarh was attacked three times (1303, 1535, and 1567-68) with the enemy becoming stronger and more skilful every time. while the victory was not achieved every time, the sacrifices of these brave souls left a deep imprint on the history of the region. the men fought till the last drop of their blood while the women performed jahaur ( self-immolation by jumping into a holy fire). the first attack in 1303 was by alauddin khilji while the second attack in 1535 was by bahadur shah of gujarat and finally by akbar who seized the fort in 1568. after the last of the attacks, rana udaisingh escaped to udaipur to establish a new capital for mewar. however, under mughal emperor jahangir (jehangir), chittor was returned to the rajputs in 1616.
