ranchi 
jagannath-mandir 
located on the outskirts of the city, this temple is one of the most revered sites in the state of jharkhand. its architecture looks a lot like the famous jagannath temple in odisha's puri and this expansive white temple can be accessed via a long flight of steps. since it is located on a hilltop, the climb can be arduous but it is worth getting to the top to get drenched in the spiritual fervour of the place. the scenery from the hilltop is absolutely breathtaking and one can also get a birds eye view of the city of ranchi. in 1691 ad, the 100-foot-tall temple was constructed by aninath shahdeo. on the occasion of rath yatra or the car festival, lakhs of devotees gather at the temple to see the huge procession of the idol of lord jagannath seated on a chariot.
