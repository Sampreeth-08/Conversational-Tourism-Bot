ananta-vasudeva-temple 
dedicated to lord vishnu, the ananta-vasudeva temple was built by queen chandrika some time during the 13th century. the temple showcases vaishnav symbols and figures, and resembles the lingaraj temple of bhubaneswar. inside, there are idols of lord krishna, lord balarama and goddess subhadra. while the idol of balarama stands under a seven-hooded serpent, that of subhadra holds a pot of jewels, and lord krishna holds a mace, chakra, lotus and conch. moreover, the temple has miniature shrines and most of the female sculptures are highly ornamented. ananta vasudeva is another name for lord vishnu, and legend has it that even before the temple was constructed, an idol of lord vishnu was worshipped here. and locals say that this legend proves an older temple existed at the same site. it is said that the marathas, who had extended their empire up to river mahanadi in this region, renovated the ananta vasudeva temple in the late 17th century. 
today, daily arti (a holy fire ritual) is organised at the temple. during the festival of janmashtami, the temple hosts a huge celebration comprising prayers and devotional songs. the layout of the temple is considerably different from others in the state of odisha. there is a peculiarity which is said to be the first of its kind in a dated temple - the main temple stands on a cruciform platform.
