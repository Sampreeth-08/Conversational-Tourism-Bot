nainital 
hanumangarhi 
dedicated to lord hanuman, the hanuman garhi temple is situated to the south of tallital, at an elevation of 6,410 ft above sea level. it is believed to have been built by a famous local saint, neem karoli baba, in 1950. a mammoth statue of the lord stands near the temple, while the sanctum sanctorum houses another idol, where the lord is seen tearing his chest to reveal the images of lord rama and goddess sita in his heart. the statue, about 22 ft high, stands against a backdrop of the panoramic himalayas. since the temple is located at a decent height, it makes for a great vantage point to catch picturesque sunrises and sunsets. gaze in awe as the burning orb of the sun slides down the horizon, leaving behind an explosion of scarlet colours. the surrounding temples of shitala devi and lila sah bapu make for a great pit stop.
