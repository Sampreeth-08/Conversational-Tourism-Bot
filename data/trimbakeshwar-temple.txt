nashik 
trimbakeshwar-temple 
located on the outskirts of nashik, the ancient trimbakeshwar temple was constructed by the third peshwa balaji bajirao (1740-1760) at the site of an even older temple. it sits at the foot of the brahmagiri hill and is flanked by the hills of nilagiri and kalagiri. 
 
made entirely of black stone, it is a beautiful pilgrimage center for hindus, dedicated to lord shiva. it is located near the town of trimbak, from where river godavari originates. kusavarta, a pond within the temple premises, represents the origin point of the holy river. 
 
the temple is among the most important in the region as it houses one of the 12 jyotirlingas. the focal point of the shivling here is the fact that it is a three-faced linga embodying lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord shiva. the linga is adorned by a crown made of diamonds, emeralds and other precious stones. the crown is displayed every monday for an hour in the evening. 
 
within the temple, you will also come across images of other gods and goddesses such as goddess gangadevi, lord jaleswara, lord rameswara, lord gautameswara, lord kedarnath, lord rama, lord krishna, lord parasurama and lord lakshmi narayana. 
 
while youï¿½re here, you can also explore the impressive brahmagiri fort, and gangadwar, located in close vicinity to the temple.
