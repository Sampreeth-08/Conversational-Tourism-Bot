trimurti cave temple
trimurti is a triple-celled temple, dedicated to the holy trinity of hinduism, the three superpowers lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord shiva. situated at the northern end of the mamallapuram hill, slightly away from krishna's butter ball, one can visit this cave temple to witness the splendour of pallava dynasty's architecture. apart from the trinity, the backside of the rock cave is adorned with fine carvings of elephants. these caves are among the very few in india that can be categorised as complete excavations. the three shrines of the cave temple have been excavated on the western facade of a hill and there are different staircases to reach all the three shrines. the three shrines are also decorated with a set of intricately carved dvarpalas or gatekeepers.
