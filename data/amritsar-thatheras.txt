thatheras
handcrafted brass and copper utensils have been made since time immemorial in amritsar. they are used for cooking in homes and restaurants even today as they are believed to be beneficial for health. the community of people who create these unique utility pieces is called thatheras. interestingly, this is the only indian craft to be part of unescoâ€™s list of intangible cultural heritage. to create these utensils, cooled cakes of metal are beaten into thin, flat plates and then hammered into a curved shape. this is how small bowls, larger pots and rimmed plates are made. the utensils are finished manually by polishing them with tamarind juice and sand. at the final stage, designs are etched into the utensils by hammering tiny dents into heated metal. the technique of making these utensils is passed down from generation to generation.
