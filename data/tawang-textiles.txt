textiles
the colours and designs found on the textiles of people in and around tawang are symbolic and vary according to the different tribes of arunachal pradesh. the use of certain kinds of clothes and ornaments is associated with the social position and achievements of the family that uses them. the designs on the fabric mostly reflect the landscape, flora and fauna motifs of the areas around the settlement. the patterns and motifs are geometrical and quite complex with their own symbolic meanings. carpet-making is a speciality of the monpa tribe, which weaves lovely designs with dragon, floral and geometric patterns. though this started as a product to use in daily life, it has become a major occupation for several women today.
