chamba paintings
situated in the ravi valley, chamba is an important centre of pahari paintings. quite similar in appearance to mughal paintings with strong influences of deccan and gujarati styles, chamba paintings have long been dominated by the basohli style, which later gave way to the guler painting tradition. though it is not confirmed when the technique of paintings was introduced in chamba, locals claim it all started in the 17th century. back then, there were probably no art workshops in chamba but there were some artists who stayed as can be found from portraits of princes of that era. perhaps some artists migrated to chamba from nurpur during the first half of the 17th century. it is also said that the naturalistic style of paintings having similarity with mughal paintings of the period of jehangir were introduced first at nurpur and later at chamba. these migrated artists or painters probably were not first-grade artists so over a period, it gradually gave way to a stylisation which was peculiar to the hills and there was a preference to more vivid colour tonalities. for example, the facial expressions got heavier in the beginning of the 18th century which later turned into a longish facial type which remained prevalent for a few decades. by the mid-18th century, the paintings from chamba got their own distinctive style as can be seen in signed and date works of that period. most common features of these paintings with generally a plain background include trees with triangular foliage and irregular trunk rows. the notable cities where the painting style flourished included nurpur, chamba, kangra, guler, mandi, garhwal, mankot and basohli.
