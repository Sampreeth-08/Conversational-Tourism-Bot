bageshwar
the city of bageshwar is located at the confluence of rivers saryu, gomti and the latent bhagirathi. it is most popularly recognised as the land of lord shiva or lord sadashiva, the redeemer of all sins (as he is revered here). tourists make a beeline for the baghnath temple, which is the major attraction. dedicated to lord shiva, it is said the temple has been standing since the 7th century. built in the nagara style of architecture, the temple is noted for hundreds of brass bells of different sizes that adorn it. the chandika devi temple, dedicated to goddess kali, and the garud baijnath (a temple that shares its similarity in architecture to the jageshwar temple complex) are some other spiritual stopovers nearby. bageshwar finds a mention in the ancient hindu text, puranas, as a place capable of liberating one from the eternal bondage of birth and death.
