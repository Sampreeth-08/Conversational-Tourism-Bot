govindraja-swami-temple 
the govindraja swamy temple is considered to be one of the most magnificent pieces of south indian architecture. moreover, it is one of the most prominent temples in the southern part of the country. it was sanctified by saint ramanujacharya in 1130 ad. legend has it that when south india was being invaded by muslim rulers, the statue of lord govindraja swamy, the presiding deity of chidambaram town, was brought to tirupati. once the danger passed, the statue was returned to its original place. it is said that the saint had a dream in which lord govindaraja swamy told him about his wish to stay in tirupati. thus, when he got to the place he had seen in his dream, he set up a statue of the lord there and advised the king to build a temple for the god. 
the temple boasts a seven-storeyed gopuram (gateway) with 11 kalasas (the pinnacle of a temple). the gopuram has handcrafted work depicting scenes from the bhagvata, the ramayana and lord venkateshwara's life. this main gopuram is followed by many small gopurams. the inner gopuram has a stunning courtyard and a huge hall made of stone. tourists often come here to take some rest from the rush of the temple. the temple hosts many festivities, especially during the time of vaisakha festival (annual brahmotsav).
