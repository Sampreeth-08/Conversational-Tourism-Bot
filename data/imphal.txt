imphal
description
ensconced in the northeastern fringes of the country, imphal, the capital of manipur, is sprawled along the valley of the pristine manipur river. ringed by snow-capped peaks and parallel ranges of verdant hills, imphal is endowed with many natural wonders. from gorgeous lakes, natural caves and emerald tea estates to lush parks and teeming flora and fauna, imphal has a lot to offer to every traveller. at the heart of the city lies the kangla fort, a grand structure standing on the bank of the imphal river. in its ruined ramparts, the fort hides vestiges of the glory of its past rulers. steeped in history, imphal's rich heritage can be traced in the various museums here, the most important of which is the manipur state museum. the city preserves its past glories and honours the martyrs with a smattering of memorials that make for an interesting visit.
a unique attraction of imphal is ima keithel or the ima market, which is probably the largest all-women market in the world. it is an amazing sight to see local women dressed in traditional phaneks (long skirts tightly draped around the waist) and innaphis (shoulder drapes very similar to shawls) setting up their shops and stalls every morning as they get ready to welcome scores of customers. as you explore the bustling bazaars of the city, don't miss out on the vibrant handicrafts on sale here. from exquisite bamboo and cane products to beautiful pottery articles, there's a fine selection of crafts on offer.
