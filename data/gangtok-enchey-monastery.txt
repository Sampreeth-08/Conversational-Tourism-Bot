enchey monastery
set on a hilltop, on the outskirts of gangtok, the enchey monastery is more than 200 years old. the word 'enchey' means aÂ  solitary temple, and the monastery is a vibrant spectacle surrounded by rolling greens.
while the present structure was built during 1909-1910 under the rule of sidkeong tulku, namgyal ruler of sikkim in 1919, the original structure is much older and was installed by lama druptob karpo. lama karpo was a tantric master, who was supposedly renowned for his ability to fly. it is believed that on his way from maenam hill, he stopped here, built a small hermitage for personal use to meditate and gave structure to the monastery. lord buddha, loketeswara and guru padmasambhava are deities worshipped here.
