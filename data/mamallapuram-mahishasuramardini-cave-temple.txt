mahishasuramardini cave temple
located at the southern end of mamallapuram hill, mahishasuramardini cave temple is noted for its reliefs that have been intricately carved into walls. one of these depicts lord vishnu sleeping on top of the coils of the king of serpents, adisesha, while another relief displays goddess durga, atop her lion, fighting with the demon mahishasura. apart from these two bas-reliefs, the shrine in the centre of the temple holds an idol of lord murugan, seated between lord shiva and goddess parvati. carved out of rocks, the temple depicts scenes from ancient hindu epics, puranas. the cave temple belongs to the 7th century, constructed under the pallava dynasty (275 ce to 897 ce). the cave is a testimony to the fine craftsmanship of the vishwakarma sculptors of that time.
