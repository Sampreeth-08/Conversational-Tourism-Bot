chola bronze
a defining art form from the times of the cholas, this craft has been adding to its legacy since the 3rd century. the ancient craft of panchaloha or bronze casting of icons became popular and reached far and wide during the rule of cholas. according to shilpa shastra rules, today the best bronze statues are made in madurai, swamimalai and tiruchirappalli. beautiful bronze statues depicting deities in various poses are made using lost wax method, which has been mentioned in the ancient texts. the larger statues are made with a hollow cast to keep their weight light, while the smaller ones are made of a solid cast. a layer of tarnish (patina) is painted over the idol to give it a sheen over a period of time.
the most popular image in chola bronze statues is nataraja or the dancing lord shiva, who was the presiding deity of the cholas. the image of somaskanda, where the lord is seen sitting with uma, his consort, and skanda, his son, is also quite popular.
