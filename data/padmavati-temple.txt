tirupati 
padmavati-temple 
this beautiful temple dedicated to goddess padmavati is situated in tiruchanur, a small town near tirupati. also called as alamelumangapuram, the temple is believed to be very significant for hindus as goddess padmavati is said to be very benevolent and readily forgives her devotees. the temple has an inscription that expounds on the history of the place. according to it, there was a temple dedicated to lord venkateshwara in tiruchanur originally. since it was quite cramped, it was difficult for priests to perform rituals and all activity was moved to another premise. eventually, only two important rituals were performed at the original site. over time, even this stopped and the place faded into insignificance. however, in the 12th century, it again came into the limelight when the yadava kings built the shri krishna balaram temple here. later, in the 16th and 17th centuries, the deity of sundara varadaraja was installed and a temple was built for goddess padmavati. legend has it that the goddess was born in a lotus pond that is now a tank within the temple. 
goddess padmavati is said to be the consort of lord venkateshwara, the presiding deity of tirupati. the idol in the temple features the goddess sitting in padmasana posture and holding two lotuses. other idols that are housed are those of lord krishna, lord balram, sundararaja swami and surya-narayana swami. a flag that has been hoisted from the temple bears the image of an elephant, which is said to be the carrier of the goddess. the best time to visit the temple is during navratri (a holy nine-day festival), dussehra and theppotsavam (boat festival) and during the month of kartheeka, when the lord is said to send gifts to goddess padmavati.
