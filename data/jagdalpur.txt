jagdalpur
description
jagdalpur, in the bastar region of chhattisgarh, is endowed with gorgeous scenery and rich cultural traditions of its local tribal population. from national parks, waterfalls, palaces and museums to natural caves and religious sites, there are many tourist delights in this place. moreover, being the capital of the southern bastar region, jagdalpur, offers, in a capsule, experiences from the entire area's rich tribal culture.
one place of interest where boundaries between castes are blurred is the haat (market), that is organised every sunday and is attended by adivasis (tribal people), acting both as shoppers and sellers. however, to get the full measure of adivasi life, one would have to explore the surrounding villages. besides, one can find many serene natural spots and heritage sites in the region. the colourful bastar palace is another landmark here. some also believe that bastar is home to the famous dandakaranya forest mentioned in the hindu epic ramayana, through which lord rama passed during his 14 year exile.
