parwanoo
a mere 30 km from chandigarh, parwanoo is a great summer retreat into the mountains. a part of the solan district of himachal pradesh, it is separated by the town of kalka by a large river bed that offers picturesque views. the scenic panoramas that parwanoo offers are accentuated by fruit orchards. since the weather is moderate and pleasant, one finds many apple and peach orchards throughout the city. as a result, parwanoo is a great place to not just buy fresh fruits but also get home-made natural fruit products like jams and preserves. near the town, one can take cable car rides through the shivalik range to admire the glorious vistas of the surrounding areas. some of the local attractions that should not be missed include timber trail, gurudwara nada sahib, kali mata temple and mansa devi temple. the kali mata temple and the mansa devi temple are quite popular and receive thousands of visitors every year. the gurudwara nada sahib is an important spot for sikh devotees.
