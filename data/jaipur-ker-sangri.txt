ker sangri
ker sangri is one of the most popular vegetable dishes of rajasthan. it is prepared with the berries of the khejri trees and sangri beans, which are soaked in mustard oil with red chilli and raw mango. the dish is often served with roti (indian flatbread) and forms an integral part of the traditional rajasthani thali. ker sangri is a unique vegetable in the sense that while the desert sun saps all manner of vegetation, khejri trees survive. their roots go so deep into the ground that they can get enough water for survival. the pods of this tree are the main constituents of the dish.
