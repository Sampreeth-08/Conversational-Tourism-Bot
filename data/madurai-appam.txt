appam
appams can be aptly called indian pancakes. they are prepared with fermented rice batter and coconut milk. appams originated in the indian subcontinent and are a common food in sri lanka, tamil nadu and kerala. they make for a great breakfast option but are also included as dinner in some parts of south india. while sri lankans call appams by their anglicised name, hoppers, people in indonesia call them as kue apem. appams get their shape from the appachattin (pan) in which they are cooked. appams are best eaten with spicy condiments or curry.
