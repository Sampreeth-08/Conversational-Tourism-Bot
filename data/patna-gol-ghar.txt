gol ghar
resembling a beehive, this impressive building is situated near the gandhi maidan, at the heart of patna. literally translated, 'gol ghar' means round house, as the building has a circular shape, with amazingly, no pillars to support it from within. it stands tall at 29 m, with 3.6-m-wide base walls, making it an architectural marvel thatâ€™s worth a visit.
the structure was built by british army's captain, john garstin, as a huge granary for his soldiers, when a famine struck this region in 1770. thousands of people were fed from this giant granary as at one time, it could hold over 13,000 tonne of grains.
