lakshmi vilas palace
a gorgeous structure built in the indo-saracenic architectural style, lakshmi vilas palace was constructed in 1890 by maharaja sayajirao gaekwad iii, the ruler of baroda (1875-1939). the palace is spread over a vast area of 500 acre and houses many architectural riches. the ornate durbar hall is perhaps the most attractive and acts as a venue for occasional cultural events and music concerts. it is adorned with belgian stained glass windows, a venetian mosaic floor and walls with intricate mosaic decorations. outside the durbar hall is an italian courtyard with pretty water fountains. also housed inside the palace are remarkable collections of old armoury, bronze, marble and terracotta sculptures. the lawns and gardens of the palace are also noteworthy and were landscaped and directed by william goldring, who was also responsible for the royal botanical gardens.
other attractions inside the palace are maharaja fateh singh museum and moti baug palace. it is said that major charles mant was the architect of this magnificent palace.
