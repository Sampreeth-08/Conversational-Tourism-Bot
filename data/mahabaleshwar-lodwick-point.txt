lodwick point
previously known as sydney point, this is a strategically located viewing point in mahabaleshwar. there is a monument dedicated to general lodwick, who was the first british officer to climb the hill in 1824. his son dedicated a 25-m-long memorial pole to him in honour of this feat, with general lodwickâ€™s head sculpted out of marble placed at the base of the pole. this point is close to 4,087 ft above sea level, and offers unmatched views of the pratapgad fort. the furthermost point of this hill is called elephant head point, because it bears resemblance to the head of an elephant.
