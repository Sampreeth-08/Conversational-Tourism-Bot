roopnath 
roopnath is home to an unusual shiva temple, whose lingam is placed in the cleft of a rock. the temple is a three-storeyed structure, whose ground floor is dedicated to lord shiva and goddess parvati and the first floor to lord rama and goddess janki (sita). the second floor is devoted to lord krishna and goddess radha. roopnath is also famous for three beautiful falls, the pools of which are named after lord rama, lord lakshmana and goddess sita. these always have clean water flowing through them. the source of the water of these kunds is a huge reservoir located above the hill. though the outfalls of the kund has been converted into a pool, bathing and swimming in it is prohibited.
