ujjain simhast kumbh
kumbh mela is probably the largest spiritual gathering in the world, held in four parts of india - haridwar, ujjain, prayagraj and nashik. it is held every four years in one of the four cities. the fair held in ujjain is called simhasth kumbh mahaparv and is held on the banks of the holy kshipra river. it is widely considered as a hindu pilgrimage in which devotees from all over the globe come together to take a dip in the sacred river. this is in effect to the belief that taking a dip in the waters would absolve them of their sins. the mela itself is a vibrant and awe-inspiring event and a great place to soak in culture and tradition.
