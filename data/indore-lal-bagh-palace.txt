lal bagh palace
famed as one of the grandest monuments built by the holkar dynasty, the lal bagh palace is an opulent multi-storey structure, situated on the outskirts of indore. its main gates are said to be a replica of the gates used in london's buckingham palace and were exclusively shipped from england. as you enter the gates, you come across a beautiful and well-laid out rose garden that surrounds the palace. the interiors of this palace are quite lavish and include italian marble columns, imposing chandeliers, carpets from persia and impressive carvings. the exquisite ballroom of the palace is an awe-inspiring sight. the palace also boasts georgian style furniture and arresting contemporary paintings from india and italy. the palace has been converted into a museum now and takes you through the pages of the rich history of the royalty.
