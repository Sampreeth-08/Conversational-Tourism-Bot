borra caves
one of the largest caves in the country, borra caves are home to million-year-old stalactite and stalagmite formations. perched at an elevation of 1,400 m above sea level, the majestic caves are a visual treat for visitors. they came into existence as a result of the flow of gosthani river on the limestone deposits in the area. some of the imposing stalactite and stalagmite formations that can be seen here include those of lord shiva and his consort goddess parvati, a mother and her child, a crocodile, a human brain and a tiger. these caves were discovered by william king george of the geological survey of india. legend has it that borra caves was first discovered when a cowherd, while searching for one of his lost cows, accidentally came across them. there he found a shivling deep inside the cave, along with his cow. he believed that lord shiva had saved his cow. later, villagers built a small temple just outside the caves. borra caves draw tourists from all across the country and are worth marking on the itinerary.
