malpua
malpua is a bihari sweet dish whose batter is a mixture of flour, milk, mashed bananas and sugar. it is then deep fried in ghee (clarified butter) and dipped in sugar syrup. this gives it a crispy crust with a melt-in-the-mouth centre. malpua can be eaten with a helping of thick rabri (a condensed milk-based dish).
