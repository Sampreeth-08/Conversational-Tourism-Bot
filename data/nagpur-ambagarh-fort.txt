ambagarh fort
bordered by verdant forests, the historic ambagarh fort is a prominent tourist stopover that is perched at a height of 300 ft above sea level. the fort holds appeal for trekkers, who can explore the nearby surroundings of the fort. while the structure is in ruins, its principal passages are well-preserved and tourists can make out the former grandeur of the 12th century fort. in close proximity lies a large tank right outside the fort complex, which is still used to supply water to the nearby villages.
