lying about 140 km from kolhapur, vijaydurg is sprawled along the arabian sea. flanked by the picturesque sahyadri ranges on the other side, vijaydurg is known for its secluded beaches, historical forts and pristine natural environs. tourists can soak in the natural beauty of this idyllic retreat and visit golden beaches that are lined with tall palm trees. vijaydurg is noted for its alphonso mango plantations and the sweet smell of the fruit lingers almost everywhere. quite popular among tourists is vijaydurg fort that was built over 300 years ago by maharaj shivaji. since it was surrounded by water on all sides, it was considered impregnable in its heyday. the structure of the fort has three layers of walls and a smattering of watchtowers that helped keep the enemy at bay. today, the fort provides sweeping views of the surrounding areas.
