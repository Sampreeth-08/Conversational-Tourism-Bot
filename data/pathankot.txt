pathankot
description
lying at the foothills of kangra and dalhousie, the small and bustling city of pathankot is like a delightful appetiser before you set out to explore the exquisite beauty of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh. criss-crossed by the beas and ravi rivers, the city enjoys a lush green landscape that is dotted with ancient forts and centuries-old temples. from the majestic shahpur kandi fort, built under the patronage of rajput chief, jaspal singh pathania, to the charming nurpur fort, named in honour of mughal empress nur jahan, pathankot preserves its age-old ties with care. tourists can soak in the charm of archaeological ruins and pay homage to one of the few temples dedicated to lord krishna and meera bai.  pathankot lies at the confluence of the three states of punjab, himachal pradesh and jammu and kashmir. its unique position as the last city on the national highway that connects jammu and kashmir with the rest of india, often makes it a rest stop before heading into the mountains of jammu and kashmir, dalhousie, chamba, kangra, dharamsala, mcleodganj, jwalaji, chintpurni and deep into the himalayas.
according to sikh history, it is believed that pathankot was established by the first sikh guru – guru nanak dev ji. in the great epic, mahabharata, pathankot is noted as audumbar and in the ancient book of ain-i-akbari, it was noted as ‘pargana headquarter’.
