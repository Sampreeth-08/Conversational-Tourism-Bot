sri meenakshi-sundareswarar temple
one of the largest temple complexes in india, sri meenakshi-sundareswarar temple is the most famous spiritual site in madurai. an excellent example of dravidian architecture, the temple is sprawled over a huge area, bordered by well-laid gardens and pristine fountains. two shrines, more than 10 gateways or gopurams, several mandapas (halls) and a giant pool, make up the structure of the temple, which is adorned with beautiful carvings inside and outside. one of the halls of the temple is famous as the "hall of a 1,000 pillars" though only 985 of them exist today. it is said that whichever direction you view these pillars from, they always seem to be in a straight line. the highlight of the temple is the outermost corridor that comprises musical pillars. these produce different musical notes when tapped. while one of the sanctorums, sundareswarar, is dedicated to lord shiva, the other is devoted to goddess meenakshi, his consort.
