takht sri harmandir sahib
this gurudwara, also known as patna sahib, marks the birth site of guru gobind singh, the last of the highly venerated 10 sikh gurus. situated in the bustling harmandir gali in patna's old quarters in the chowk area, this sacred shrine is now known as one of the five takhts (sikh seats of authority) of sikhism. it was built by maharaja ranjit singh, the well-known ruler of punjab.
the gurudwara houses several personal belongings of guru gobind singh, which include four iron arrows, weapons, a pair of sandals, and a pangura (cradle) with four stands covered with golden plates, which was the guru's cradle during his childhood. the "hukamnamas" of guru gobind singh and guru tegh bahadur are written in a book, which is kept here. the gurudwara sees significant footfalls during the festivities of guru nanak jayanti.
