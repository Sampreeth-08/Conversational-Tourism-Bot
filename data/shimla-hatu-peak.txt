hatu peak
the second-highest peak in shimla district, hatu, about 3,400 m high, lies on the outskirts of the city. tourists can visit the quaint town of narkanda that is situated atop the peak. the town serves as a transit camp for travellers heading to spiti valley and other higher reaches of himachal pradesh. narkanda is home to the iconic hatu temple, dedicated to hatu mata, an incarnation of goddess kali. constructed entirely out of timber, the temple is a highly revered site in the region. narkanda is also home to the 18th-century stokes farm, which is widely known for its apple orchards. allow the generous stokes family to give you a free guided tour where you can see varieties of apples and several experiments being done in collaboration with leading agro companies. narkanda has also emerged as a haven for adventure enthusiasts and offers great opportunities for trekking, skiing and other popular winter sports.
