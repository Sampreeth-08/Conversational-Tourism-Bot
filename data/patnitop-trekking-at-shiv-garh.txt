trekking at shiv garh
enjoy the company of lush wooded pine forests on a day's walk to shiv garh. it is a starting point for long and short treks to nearby mountains and makes for a rich experience. around 11 km away from patnitop, shiv garh is quite peaceful, and offers splendid views of the mountain towns of kud and batote. as you drive down the road, the mighty himalayas seem to accompany you on your journey, and the sun plays hide and seek amidst the tall pine trees. since it is still known only to a few intrepid travellers, chances are you will not be disturbed.
