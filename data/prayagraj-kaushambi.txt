kaushambi
while the present-day district was carved from the city of prayagraj in 1997, the heritage site of kaushambi is steeped in history. not only does it find mention in the hindu epics ramayana and mahabharata but was once a popular centre for buddhist learnings as well. in fact, during the time of lord buddha, kaushambi was one of the six important and flourishing towns in india. it played host to lord buddha twice when he came to deliver discourses.the texts of the puranas, however, narrate a different story. according to that, nicaksu, a ruler of the bharata kingdom, transferred his capital from hastinapur to kaushambi after the former was washed away in a flood. an old fort, an ashokan pillar, large number of figurines, cast coins, terracotta objects, sculptures and a grand monastery were unearthed here during excavation that reflect its rich history.
