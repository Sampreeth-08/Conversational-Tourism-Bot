sibsagar 
built around a 129 acre artificial tank called the sivasagar tank, the sivasagar town, around 50 km from jorhat, previously and popularly renowned as sibsagar, literally translates into the ocean of lord shiva. there is a lot to explore in this upper assam tourist destination yet the most significant attraction is the sivasagar tank, which was built more than 200 years ago. 
 
the presence of historical monuments belonging to the ahom times (1228-1826) is considered the pride of the town and so are the tea gardens surrounding it. other important attractions one can look out for are the temples around the tank namely, the shiva dol, the vishnu dol and the devidol. all these temples were built by queen madambika in the year 1734. talatal ghar, kareng ghar and gargaon palace are some of the popular palaces in the town.
