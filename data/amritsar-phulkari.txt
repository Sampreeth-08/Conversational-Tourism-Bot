phulkari
the traditional embroidery of punjab, phulkari or flower work features colourful geometric patterns stitched in a dense formation. it is generally practiced on bedspreads, dupattas and suit fabrics. the hallmark of this embroidery is the use of darn stitch with a colourful silk thread on the wrong side of the cloth. there are a variety of motifs that are weaved in phulkari embroidery, most of which depend upon the occasion. while the wari da bagh (made on an orange-red khaddar and embroidered on the whole surface) is a symbol of happiness, chope (a two-sided line stitch that appears the same on both sides and is usually done on the borders) is generally a gift from the maternal uncle to the bride. chamba, ghunghat bagh and suber are some of the other varieties of phulkari. this embroidery was initially done by women as a past time and it takes about 80 days to prepare a phulkari embroidered salwaar kameez. the technique of phulkari is believed to have been brought to the indian subcontinent by the jats of central asia.
