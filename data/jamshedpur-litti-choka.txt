litti choka
a trip to jamshedpur would be incomplete without relishing the freshly cooked litti chokha, the trademark dish of bihar and jharkhand. one of the most famous food items of the state, litti (dough ball made of whole wheat flour and stuffed with sattu [roasted chickpea flour]) is eaten with chokha (baigan bharta), aloo bharta, papad and yoghurt.
