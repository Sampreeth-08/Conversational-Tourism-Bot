festival of light
khogla festival celebrated in pattan valley is called the festival of light. the date of the festival, which usually coincides with magh purnima (full moon), is decided by a lama from pattan valley. haldas, made of cedar branches, are cut into strips and tied together to form a bunch. they are then lit in every house in the village and brought to one central place in the evening. this ritual is repeated around five times, in order to honour different deities.
