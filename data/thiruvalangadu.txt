kanchipuram 
thiruvalangadu 
the main temple here is known as vadaranyeshwar, dedicated to lord shiva, and is one of the 275 shaivaite sites in the state of tamil nadu.Â it is also one of the five majestic cosmic dance halls (pancha sabhai). this particular dance hall is known as ratna sabhai. according to legend, when the lord was performing a cosmic dance, his anklet fell down to earth and broke into five pieces, one of them being thiruvalangadu. in fact, a bronze statue of nataraj, lord of the dance, was unearthed here, which is now preserved in the art section of the chennai government museum. 
many believe that the temple was built by the chola dynasty in the 12th century, however, inscriptions have been found that point to the 5th century. the locals say that before you enter vadaranyeshwar, you need to first pray at the kali temple situated behind it.
