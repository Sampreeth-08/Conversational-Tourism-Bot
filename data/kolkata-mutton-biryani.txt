mutton biryani
involving the traditional process of using 'pakki' – pre-cooked goat meat – in basmati rice, mutton biryani is a well-loved dish of kolkata. to give it a distinct aroma and flavour, it is slow-cooked on 'dum' – kneaded wheat flour is used to seal the utensil in which the biryani is cooking, and it needs to be made on a wood fire or on a charcoal stove so that it gets its unmatched smoky aroma. some of the spices used include saffron, nutmeg and star anise.
