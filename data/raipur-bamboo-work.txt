bamboo work
tribal craftsmen of chhattisgarh have been making several types of utilitarian and home d√©cor items with bamboo since ages. bamboo is available in abundance in the state and traditional products include agricultural implements, fishing traps, hunting tools and baskets. you can shop for bamboo wall hangings, table lamps and table mats. some of the tribes that are known for their exquisite bamboo work are gond, baiga, basor (basod) and korku. this craft was originally practised by them as a past time and to make products to meet their daily requirements. bamboo product-making is basically a household industry that does not use mechanical devices.
the process involves cutting the whole stem of bamboo and cane with a hacksaw and then splitting it longitudinally into various sizes. after that, the cane is heated on the slow flame of a kerosene lamp to make it flexible. this is done for two purposes: coiling for baskets and weaving for mats. to make baskets, cane is coiled around a central core to lay the foundation. it is then built up spirally and the width is increased gradually until the desired height is attained. the coils are joined to each other by sewing strips and eventually, the whole basket takes shape. lastly, ornamentation is done by decorating with lace, paper and shells.
