undavalli-caves 
dating back to the 7th century bc, the undavalli caves, carved out of a single sandstone, are a prime example of india's rock-cut architectural heritage. the inviting design of the caves speaks volumes about the advanced architectural skills of the ancient viswakarma architects and temple builders. the caves are said to have been associated with the influential vishnukundina dynasty, which ruled over important parts of india between 420 ad and 620 ad. these caves are a fine specimen of gupta architecture as well, and the detailed design on the second floor reflects chalukyan architecture. the largest cave has four floors and houses a huge statue of lord vishnu in a reclining posture. it is said that this sculpture was carved out of a single block of granite. the first storey of the caves houses sculptures of jain tirthankaras (saints) that suggest that they once served as a home for jain monks. the walls on the first floor are covered with stunning frescoes that depict scenes from mythological stories. the facade of the third floor hosts numerous sculptures that include depictions of lions and elephants. nearby is another unique cave dedicated to lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord shiva. 
 
the architecture and green surroundings of the undavalli caves will remind you of bhubaneswar's udaygiri caves.
