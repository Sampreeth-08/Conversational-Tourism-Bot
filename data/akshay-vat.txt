akshay-vat 
believed to be the oldest standing tree on earth, akshay vat is a banyan tree that has been mentioned in many religious texts. legend has it that goddess sita once blessed the akshay vat (tree) to be immortal and never ever shed a leaf in any season. another story says that lord narayan once flooded the earth to display his powers to sage markandeya, and the only thing that was not submerged was this tree. in the epic ramayana, this tree has been said to be the resting place of lord rama. jain scriptures also declare that a tirthankara, rishabha, once meditated extensively under this tree. thus, it is considered sacred by the jains. akshay vat lies in close proximity to the vishnupad temple.
