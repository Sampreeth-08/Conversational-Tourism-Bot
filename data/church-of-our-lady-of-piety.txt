church-of-our-lady-of-piety 
situated right opposite tribal museum, the church of our lady of piety is one of the oldest churches in the region. built by the portuguese in the latter part of the 18th century, the church is noted for its imposing gothic architecture and bears a stark resemblance to barcelona's sagrada familia, which was designed by renowned architect antoni gaudi. the structure has grey exteriors built with stone and stands as a testament to the rich colonial past of dadra and nagar haveli. the main altar of the church is truly magnificent and its wooden pews are also impressive. one of the walls of the church is decorated with a mural of the famous last supper, which is a great work of art. the stained glass windows of the church add to its grandeur. the church can be visited on all days of the week from 7 am to 7 pm.
