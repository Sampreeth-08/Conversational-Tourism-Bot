kanyakumari 
suchindram 
the pilgrim town of suchindram is famous for the thanumalayan temple, an important citadel of the travancore rulers in the 18th century. located on the outskirts of the city, the temple is unique in that it is dedicated to the three deities of the holy trinity, which are represented in an image in the sanctum sanctorum called sthanumalayan (sthanu for lord shiva, mal for lord vishnu and ayan for lord brahma) kovil. 
 
legend has it that suchindram is connected with the chastity of the wife of sage atri, anusuya. it goes on to add that the holy trinity of lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord shiva turned into brahmins and went begging from anusuya. just as she was about to serve them, the three said they would only consume food if she served in the nude. she turned the three gods into babies using her power of chastity and fed them. and it was only when the wives of lord brahma, lord vishnu and lord shiva intervened that anusuya restored them. it is said that a linga developed at this spot, which exists till date and is worshipped. the festivals of markazhi and chiththirai are famous and celebrated with full fervour.
