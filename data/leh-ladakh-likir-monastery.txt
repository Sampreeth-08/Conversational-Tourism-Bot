likir monastery
located about 62 km west of leh, likir monastery was built on the land that was blessed by lama duwang chosje. it is said that since the monastery was encircled by the bodies of the two great serpent spirits, the naga- rajas, it came to be known as ‘likir’ meaning ‘the naga – encircled’. the monastery flourished in the 15th century. even today, the three basic pratimoksa disciplines, which are the basis of all buddhist teachings, are observed. the monastery is home to many shrines. every year, on the 27th to 29th days of the twelfth month of the tibetan calendar, the votive offerings known as dosmochey are offered and holy dances are performed.
