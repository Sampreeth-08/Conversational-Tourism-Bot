pagal-baba-temple 
this gorgeous temple is situated at the entrance of vrindavan and is built in white marble. it was built by a saint named pagal baba, whose real name is sri sheela nand ji maharaj. it is said that sheela nand ji was a judge in the high court of calcutta (now kolkata), and decided to spend his retirement in vrindavan in search of spirituality. he wandered around like a mad man, and the locals started referring to him as 'pagal baba'. 
the temple is a seven-storey structure and each storey is dedicated to a different avatar of lord krishna. for a bird's eye view of the surrounding area, climb to the top floor. enjoy puppet shows depicting scenes from epics like mahabharata and ramayana on the ground floor. the festivals of holi and janmashtami are the best times to visit.
