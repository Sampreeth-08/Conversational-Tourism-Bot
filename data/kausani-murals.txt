murals
found on the walls of important and sacred places, murals form an important aspect of the spiritual and aesthetic identity of the region. temple murals are quite elaborate and intricate and are worth every visitor’s time. individual mural traditions like aipan (rangoli or coloured patterns) are also an important part of the region’s culture. these are actually wall or floor paintings that can be considered as variations of murals. aipans are decidedly geometric, with a natural grace and simplicity. a lot of nature-inspired designs are also used in aipan. these elaborate designs are traditionally made with rice paste on a red floor and are considered to be extremely auspicious. decorating homes with aipan is an important part of any celebration or festival in the region.
