pattachitra
a traditional art form, pattachitras are miniature paintings with religious themes. stories from the hindu epics and legends from the lives of hindu gods and goddesses are painted on a specially treated fabric called patta. the word 'pattachitra' literally means a painted piece of cloth. with bright colours and intricate details, these paintings can be used as wall decor items. practiced widely in raghurajpur and dandasahi villages, on the outskirts of puri, these pattas have become synonymous to the place.
another renowned handicraft of odisha is sand carving. this involves carving a sculpture with just clean and fine-grained sand mixed with water. attractive sculptures are carved out of sand by odia artists.
