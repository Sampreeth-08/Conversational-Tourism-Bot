offering beautiful views of the city of haridwar, mansa devi temple is situated on the bilwa parwat. it has two impressive statues of goddess mansa devi – one with three mouths and five arms and the other with eight arms. goddess mansa is believed to be a form of goddess shakti, who came from the mind of sage kashyap. this temple is among the 51 shaktipeethas (devotional shrines where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell) in the country. there are two other  shaktipeethas in haridwar: chandi devi and maya devi temples. 
one can go via the ropeway in a trolley to this temple or simply trek up the hill. it is said that the goddess grants all wishes that are made by tying a thread on the branches of a holy tree in the temple. one must also come back to untie the thread once the wish has been fulfilled.
