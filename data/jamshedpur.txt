jamshedpur
description
situated at the confluence of rivers subarnrekha and kharkai, the steel city of india, jamshedpur, in jharkhand, echoes with the legacy of jamsetji nusserwanji tata (founder of the tata group of companies), who founded the city. the largest city in the state, jamshedpur is dotted with lakes that are surrounded by neatly manicured gardens. open emerald spaces, lofty hills, lush forests and pristine waterfalls adorn the suburbs of the city, making it a green paradise.
though it has been developed as one of the most planned industrial cities in the country, there are several tourist retreats for visitors to explore. lying at the heart of the city, the jubilee park, a gift from the tata group to the residents of the city, is the main attraction here. from musical fountains to amazing laser installations inspired by singapore's sentosa island, the park enchants visitors with its diversity and vibrancy. also called tata nagar, jamshedpur acts as a gateway to other cities and towns of the state.
