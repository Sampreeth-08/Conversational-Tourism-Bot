sidi saiyyed mosque
built in 1573, the sidi saiyyed mosque lies off the eastern edge of the nehru bridge and is a remarkable structure. it is documented as the last major mosque built in ahmedabad under the mughal rule. though it does not have a courtyard and is much smaller in size than the jama masjid, the mosque is famous for its craftsmanship. inside the mosque are iconic windows with intricate, stone-filigree jaalis, one of which represents the tree of life. in this window, the jaali work has a tree with intertwining and overlapping branches. the carvings are so intricate that they look like fine lace. the mosque was constructed during the last year of the rule of gujarat sultanate and is a symbol of the time when gujarat prospered under the rule of muslim sultans.
