krimchi temples
also known as pandava temples by local people, the three ancient krimchi temples are dedicated to lord vishnu, lord ganesha, lord shiva and goddess parvati. the temples are believed to have been built in the 11th and 12th centuries ad, and are perhaps the oldest in the state of jammu and kashmir. the architecture speaks of a predominant greek (hellenic) style. these temples are situated on a stone complex, skirted by a small stream. the temples have an abstract architecture and house fascinating sculptures of hindu deities. the main temple is 50-ft-high. a popular legend associated with the place is that raja kichak of the epic mahabharata developed the town of krimchi and pandavas took shelter here during some years of their exile and hence the temples are sometimes called after them.
