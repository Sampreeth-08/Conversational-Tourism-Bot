bhuna gosht
a host of spices and yoghurt are used to make this richly flavoured traditional mutton curry.Â  the gosht is cooked for a long time to ensure the flavours are well infused into the meat. the word 'bhuna' in asian cooking means cooking the curry until it is reduced and becomes thick. this way it gets more easily coated to the meat, which appears brown in colour. served with jeera (cumin) rice, bhuna ghost makes a great option for lunch or dinner.
