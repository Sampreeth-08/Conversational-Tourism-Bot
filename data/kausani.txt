perched at a height of 1,890 m above sea level, kausani is a haven for trekkers, who are greeted by clear and mesmerising views of meadows, waterfalls and the many pine forests that make up the profile of the region. the best time for adventure sports is after monsoons. the climate of kausani ranges between cool and cold and if one wishes to avoid the cold, the best time to visit is between april to june and then between september and november. though for those who like wispy winters and snowfalls, kausani is a treat at any time of the year.
