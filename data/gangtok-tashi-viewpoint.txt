tashi viewpoint
on a clear day, tourists can avail breathtaking sights of mt khangchendzonga and mt siniolchu, as well as the colourful villages of north sikkim, from the tashi viewpoint. the tourism department of the state has added a resting shed and a park with a small cafeteria so visitors can make a day out of this trip. while sunsets and sunrises are favourable timings, the sun shining down through the clouds at all hours of the day also makes this viewpoint worth a visit. soak up some sun, gaze out at the valleys and the mountains and look for the labrang and phodong monasteries hidden amidst fluffy clouds.
grab a cup of warm tea as you soak in the peace and quiet beauty of the himalayas at tashi; itâ€™s an unmissable experience for first-time visitors. while there is no admission fee, there are extra charges levied on renting of binoculars, and using the telescope mounted here to get a closer look at the surrounding mountains. the site was built by the late king of sikkim and lies about 8 km from gangtok.
