sita-kund 
situated on the bank of river falgu, on the opposite side of vishnupad temple, lies sita kund. it is believed to be the spot where sita devi performed the ritual of pinda-daan for king dashratha, her father-in-law and a small temple stands there now. another legend says that this is the spot where the goddess took a bath before going into exile for 14 years with her husband, lord rama, and brother-in-law, lord lakshmana. tourists can also visit nearby shrines dedicated to lord rama, lord hanuman, goddess sita and goddess durga and pay obeisance to the deities. today, this pond is a significant spiritual site, where devotees come to soak in sacred vibes and admire tranquil surroundings.
