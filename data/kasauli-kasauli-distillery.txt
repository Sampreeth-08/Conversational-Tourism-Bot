kasauli distillery
one of the oldest distilleries in asia to make scotch whiskey, the kasauli distillery was set up in the late 1820s by the british. the distilling and brewing equipment was brought to india from england and scotland on ship in the early part of the 19th century. from there, it was loaded on ox-drawn carts and brought here through shimla. interestingly, copper pot stills (a type of distillation apparatus or still used to distill alcoholic spirits like cognac and whiskey) from that period are in use at the distillery till today.
it is said that the brewery launched asia’s first beer, lion, back then. it was majorly in demand as the british army was stationed in kasauli in those days. the first product that rolled out from kasauli brewery was indian pale ale and malt whiskey. as time passed, more and more people started settling down in kasauli, which resulted in them using the spring water more and more. therefore, the brewery was shifted to solan where it exists even today. however, the distillery still works at kasauli and that is the reason it is said to be the oldest operating distillery in continuous operation in the world. kasauli distillery rolled out single malt whiskey brand, solan no. 1, as its main whiskey brand which kept its numero uno status for over a century as the country’s bestseller. today, the company is known for old monk rum, colonel’s special, diplomat deluxe, summer hall and black knight. if you want to have a look around the brewery to watch how it all worked, visit the kasauli distillery between 7 am and 7 pm. and don’t miss the old steam engine near the entrance of the brewery.
