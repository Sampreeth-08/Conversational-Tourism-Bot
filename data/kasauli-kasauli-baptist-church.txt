kasauli baptist church
apart from the popular christ church, kasauli also boasts the baptist church, which was constructed by the british in 1923. this quaint old structure is among the townâ€™s many attractions. the architecture of the church is a blend of gothic and indian styles. a particular highlight of the church is the stained glass windows that depict scenes from the holy bible. though the church was destroyed in a massive fire in 2008 and all its internal furnishings were burnt to the ground, it still remains a pulling force in the region. its calm surroundings, the silent pine forest bordering it and rejuvenating sounds of chirping birds make it an attractive spot for tourists. the church remains open from 7 am to 7 pm, from monday to sunday.
