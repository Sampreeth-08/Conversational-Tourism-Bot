mathura-vrindavan 
prem-mandir 
also known as the temple of divine love, prem mandir is dedicated to goddess radha and lord krishna, and lord rama and goddess sita. it was shaped and designed by jagadguru shri kripaluji maharaj in 2001, and is sprawled over 54 acre. considered as one of the most beautiful and elegant structures in vrindavan, this italian white marble temple is dedicated to the major events of lord krishnaâ€™s life, and the interiors depict those scenes, including the raising of govardhan hill. 
a grand music fountain, where a pleasing sound and light show takes place in the evening, is one of the most interesting attractions of this religious site. the pathways through the garden, a restaurant, shop and fountains are all part of the temple. prayers and assemblies are held in a large, pillar-less, dome-shaped satsang hall that can accommodate as many as 25,000 people at a time. 
today, it is run and maintained by jagadguru kripalu parishat, an international non-profit, educational, spiritual, and charitable trust. it is a much-frequented religious site for couples, young and old, who come here to be inspired by the eternal bond of who are perhaps the greatest examples of love and devotion in indian mythology.
