durgiana temple
this traditional hindu temple dedicated to goddess durga was built in the 16th century and is a well-known repository of hindu scriptures. thus, it draws a number of scholars and hindu sages along with devotees who come here to worship hindu deities, goddess lakshmi and lord narayan. the temple is also known as the lakshmi narayan temple.
the architecture of the temple resembles the style of the golden temple, which is located nearby. it has canopies and a central dome and much like the famous gurdwara, it rises from the midst of a tank of holy water. it was rebuilt in the third decade of the 20th century by pandit madan mohan malviya, a great reformer and political leader of resurgent india. this temple, with its peaceful precincts, has beautifully engraved silver doors and is hence also known as the silver temple.
