aizawl
description
its unhurried pace of life, natural abundance, and serene essence make aizawl, the capital of mizoram, a city perfect for a relaxing holiday. perched on almost vertical ridges, aizawl is dotted with quaint churches, neat neighbourhoods and patches of green and emerald blue lakes. the durtlang peaks, surrounding the city, make a picturesque backdrop for the gushing tlawng and tuirial rivers. while the overall aura of the city is tranquil, its bustling bazaars and action-packed adventure scene are quite boisterous. from rafting in river tlawng, angling and cave tourism to paragliding in durtlang cliffs and mountaineering, aizawl appeals to thrill seekers.
the oval-shaped palak dil lake is the centerpiece of the city. the largest natural lake in the state, it leaves one awestruck with its beauty. add to that the colourful and vibrant tribal culture that you can closely experience in the city, and you can see why aizawl is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the northeast. the name 'aizawl' literally translates into a field of wild cardamom and it is said that it originated when thanruma and lalsavunga, mizo chiefs in the 19th century, set up the villages in and around the present site of raj bhavan.
