weapons
weapons have been an integral part of tribal lives of the state for centuries.  they are meant for use in day to day tasks as well as a means of defence in times of war. thus, a wide selection of weaponry is produced locally. though some of them have now become obsolete, they have been replaced by modern and more innovative ones. the akas tribe is known for their bow and arrow, known by the names of tkeri and moo respectively. these are used extensively during a chase and vary in size according to the user's requirement. the arrows that are used in hunting are bigger in size and are fitted with tips of iron and smeared with aconite poison. they are stored in a bamboo case called thouvou. on the other hand, the bows are usually hung over the shoulders.
