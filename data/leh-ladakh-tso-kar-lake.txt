tso kar lake
the smallest of the three high-altitude lakes of ladakh, the remote tso kar lake lies about 50 km from tso moriri. situated at a height of 15,280 ft, it is bordered by lofty mountains that are home to the elusive snow leopard. also called white lake due to the white salt content in the water deposits on its shore, it leaves visitors in awe of its beauty. the area surrounding the lake is rife with wildlife and flora, and it also makes for an important point for bird watchers, especially during migration season when several species come here to lay their eggs, including the black-necked cranes. the nomadic settlements of thugje and gursan are guardians of the lake and its surrounding area. the ideal time to visit this lake is between the months of may and august.
