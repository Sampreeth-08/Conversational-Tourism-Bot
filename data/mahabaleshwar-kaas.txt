kaas
kaas, also known as plateau of a million flowers, has been declared a unesco world heritage site, and is home to some rare endemic species of flowers. it sees a riot of colours during the monsoon months – july, august and september, when the entire landscape is transmogrified into an artist's canvas. every 15-20 days, the colours of the plateau change, as different species bloom and wither within a short span of time. more than 850 species of plants and flowers have been reported here, and the large diversity of flora has allowed for a significant research in botanical studies to take place. another attraction is the beautiful kaas lake, which is also the source of river urmodi. set amidst peaceful and picturesque surroundings, the lake is a popular picnic spot.
a stone's throw away lies a waterfall that also invites tourists. however, what makes kaas mesmerising is a plethora of blooms that carpet the land. from the golden-hued smithias (mickey mouse flowers) and sonkis to the pink-lavender-purple balsams, white blooms of gend-eriocalulon that look like heads and peach murdania that has a sprinkling of gold dust on its petals, the flora family of the region is simply breathtaking. you can also keep an eye out for the beautiful seeta’s tears (utricularia) that have small bladders around the roots to trap small insects, orchids like the greenish-yellow habeneria digitata and the ceropegia that looks like a lantern and is also known as kandil kharchudi. the main attraction is the pleocaulus ritchei, locally known as topli karvi or an upside down basket, which flowers once in eight years and then dies. the blooms look like baskets of purple flowers! and then there are bees, butterflies, insects and frogs and a variety of other fauna that leave tourists delighted.
