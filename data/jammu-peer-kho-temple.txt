peer kho temple
with igneous rocks and acacia caves as a backdrop, the peer kho temple is a stoneâ€™s throw from the centre of the city. the temple comprises two caves that are 20 to 30 ft deep with a flight of marble steps. a 3-ft-wide cave is followed by a large cave that is 12-ft-high with a naturally formed shivling which is the centre point. while the exact time of the construction of the temple is unknown, many believe that it is the most ancient temple in the shivalik region. there are several legends associated with the origin of this temple. one of the more popular stories says that jamvant, the bear god from the epic ramayana, meditated here, which is why it is also known as the jamvant cave.
