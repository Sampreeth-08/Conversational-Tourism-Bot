patna
food-and-cuisine
kebabs
patna is a haven for non-vegetarian cuisine and several restaurants and street vendors serve mildly-spiced, melt-in-your-mouth mutton and reshmi kebabs. this dish is a close kin of the kebab that was popularised by turkish soldiers during the 11th and 12th centuries. though it follows a rustic style of preparation, when it comes to taste, it can rival the royal versions created under the awadhi rule in other parts of the country.
