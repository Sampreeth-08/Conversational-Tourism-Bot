masks
made using papier mache, these traditional masks are a vivid portrayal of deities and demons from mythological stories. to make these, paper is dipped in clay and then pasted over a clay model. once dry, the mask is taken off the mould and painted in vibrant shades. the purulia district is well-known as the hub for this art. the mask may be used to decorate homes or as an accessory to participate in folk festivals.
