amritsari fish
you will find this delicacy in any local street food stall as well as the premium five-star hotels of amritsar city. freshwater fish called singhara or sole is used to make this delicious spicy and fried fish dish. the fish is tender and succulent on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. a  perfect snack for cold winter evenings, it is served  with mint-and-coriander chutney. in colloquial language, the dish is known as amritsari machhi. in earlier times, the poor, who were settled near the rivers, would cook fish extensively as it was easily available. soon fish-based dishes found their way into the mughal kitchens, where various innovations were added using masalas and cooking techniques.
