kumarakom bird sanctuary
spread over 14 hectare, the kumarakom bird sanctuary is located on the banks of lake vembanad in kottayam. it is a popular destination for birdwatching as migratory birds flock here in large numbers from siberia and the himalayas. the best season to visit the sanctuary is between june and august as it is the breeding season of wetland birds like white ibis, herons, egrets, indian darters and kingfishers. some other not-to-be-missed avian breeds one can spot are wood beetles, larks, flycatchers, parrots, teals, siberian cranes, owls, water duck and waterfowls. an intriguing way to visit the sanctuary is on a boat trip that gives a closer look of the birds flocking around the water body. for a more comprehensive experience, tourists can stay in independent cottages on stilts at the backwater resort of kerala tourism development corporation (ktdc).
