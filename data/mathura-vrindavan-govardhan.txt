govardhan
a sacred hindu site in the mathura district, it is situated on a hill called giriraj. according to legend, young lord krishna held the govardhan mountain on his little finger for seven days. he did so to save braj from torrential rain caused by devraj indra (the lord of rain), who had cursed the people for failing to please him. another legend speaks of how the hill ascended from heaven to become a part of lord krishnaâ€™s divine leela. today, it is believed that completing a parikrama (circumambulation) of govardhan hill will grant all your wishes.
govardhan is vastly important for devotees, who flock here during krishna janmashtami and other festivals associated with the deity. a huge statue of his dominates the skyline of govardhan, further emphasising its connection with lord krishna and his life.
