dal-bafla
quite similar to dal bati of rajasthan, dal bafla is made with wheat balls that are boiled and baked. the wheat balls are crumbled and dal is poured over them to create this lip-smacking dish. laden with ghee, dal bafla has a very soft texture. it is best served with pudina chutney, onion and a tall glass of buttermilk.
