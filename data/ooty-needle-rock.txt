also called soosi malai, the needle rock viewpoint lies 8 km away from gudalur on the ootacamund-gudalur national highway. needle rock is the perfect place to get a 360 degree view of the grasslands of nilgiri and the beautiful valley bellow. standing between pykara and cuddalore, needle rock is conical in shape and is a very picturesque location. a view of the sunset from here is possible on clear sky days. one can also get a panoramic view of the mudumalai wildlife sanctuary from here, which is one of the first sanctuaries to be set up in south india. the sanctuary is home to many avifauna, including  hornbills, minivets, fairy blue birds and jungle fowls, making it a paradise for birdwatchers.
