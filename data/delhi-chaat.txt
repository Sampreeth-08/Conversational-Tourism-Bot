chaat
such is the popularity of chaat in the capital that the streets of delhi host a chaat-wala or a vendor at every corner. the highlight of the chaat scene is gol gappa, which is bite-size puffed up fried bread filled with potatoes and tamarind water. a must-try is kulle-ki-chaat, which is made by hollowing out fruits and vegetables, and then filling them with pomegranate pearls and boiled chickpeas. it is bathed with lemon juice and topped with chaat masala. you can also try aloo chaat, which is prepared by frying diced potatoes and then smearing them in a spicy batter. a plate of tikki (fried potato patty) drizzled with tamarind chutney and mint chutney also makes a great choice. legend has it that chaat was created in the kitchens of mughal emperor shah jahan. it is said that since the water of yamuna was very polluted at that time, the cooks started preparing very oily and spicy food to combat the effects of harmful water. this is how chaat came into being.
