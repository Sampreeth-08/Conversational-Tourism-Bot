shekhawati
description
tucked away in the northern desert reaches of rajasthan, shekhawati remains suspended in time, dotted with grand havelis with beautiful frescos and murals, and ancient temples and stepwells adorned with intricate carvings. a reflection of the opulent lifestyle of the wealthy merchants of the region, shekhawati boasts the legacy of the traders who bestowed it with its architectural gems. a photographer's dream, every nook and cranny of the district is alive with the vibrancy of colourful paintings that are almost like a picture story, revolving around religious legends, folklore and highlights of its lavish past. most of these havelis were abandoned by their owners, when they migrated to other parts of the country for trade. today, they have been restored and turned into museums, heritage resorts and hotels.
the history of shekhawati is rooted in the matsya kingdom and has also been mentioned in the ancient indian texts of rig veda and manusmriti. rao shekha from dhundhar established shekhawati with its capital at amarsar. he divided the region into 33 villages that were fortified with mud and stone forts. a prominent trading centre of the 14th century, shekhawati is now a tourist hub in rajasthan.
