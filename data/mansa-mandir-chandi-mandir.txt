mansa-mandir-chandi-mandir 
both mansa and chandi temples are very popular and a visit to both can easily be clubbed together as they lie only 10 km away from each other. the chandi mandir is dedicated to goddess chandi, who is believed to be the goddess of power. it is a shaktipeetha (devotional shrine where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell), from which the city of chandigarh draws its name. a large number of visitors come to worship at this temple at the time of the navratris, a nine-day holy festival. 
the chandigarh mansa devi temple is located in panchkula, whichÂ  is 8 km away from the city. this too is a shaktipeetha dedicated to mata mansa devi. according to local legend, the head of goddess sati fell here and as a result, a temple was built in her honour. there are two temples in the mansa devi premises. the main temple was believed to have been established by the ruler of manimajra (a historical town in chandigarh) in 1815 ad. the new temple, however, is credited to the maharaja of patiala. a scenic garden with a large number of medicinal plants has also been created right next to the temple where visitors can relax. the festivities of navratri see large footfalls.
