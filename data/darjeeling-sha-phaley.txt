sha phaley
sha phaley is a type of tibetan potsticker that is stuffed with meat (usually beef or pork in the northeast). it is served best with any curry or even with chutney or vegetables. a popular accompaniment to sha phaley is tsampa (roasted barley) that is served with cheese or butter. you can also have it with a basic rutang soup, creating a healthy, delicious and filling meal.
its preparation is quite simpleÂ  minced ginger, garlic, bok choy, green onion and other vegetables are mixed together with the main protein, along with soy sauce; the dough is then stuffed with this mixture and lightly fried. this snack food is quite the favourite in darjeeling, with restaurants big and small selling different variants of it across town. it also makes an appearance during festivals and other celebrations.
