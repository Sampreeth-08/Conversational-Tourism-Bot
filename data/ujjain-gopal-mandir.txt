gopal mandir
located at the heart of the market square, gopal mandir is a glorious example of maratha architecture. it was constructed in the 19th century by the queen of maharaj daulat rao shinde- bayajibai shinde. a towering marble structure, the temple is dedicated to lord krishna. while the sanctum sanctorum has been inlaid with marble and has silver-plated doors along with a patch of gemstone plate, the inner sanctum was taken away to ghazni. thereafter, it was taken to lahore by mahmud shah abdali. the sanctum sanctorum houses the idols of lord krishna (black) and goddess radha (white). there are also statues of devi rukmani and shiv parvati on either side of the main shrine. the temple hosts a grand celebration annually on the occasion of bhadrakrishna janmashtami.
