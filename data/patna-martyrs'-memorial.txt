martyrs' memorial
the martyr’s memorial or shaheed smarak was constructed in the honour of seven young freedom fighters, who gave up their life during the quit india movement of 1942 in the struggle for india’s independence. it is a fairly modern structure that is located opposite the patna secretariat (also known as patna sachiwalaya or old secretariat) in the heart of the city.
this life-size sculpture of the seven bravehearts marks the location where these freedom fighters fell after being shot while attempting to hoist the indian national flag atop the assembly building. it is believed that dr anugrah narain, a well-known follower of mahatma gandhi’s ideals, was arrested while he tried to unfurl the tricolour in patna. as a reaction to his arrest, the seven students attempted to hoist the national flag on their own but were killed by the british. the names of the freedom fighters are inscribed on the memorial. umakant prasad sinha (raman ji), ramanand singh, satish prasad jha, jagatpati kumar, devipada choudhry, rajendra singh and ramgovind singh… all of them were the victims of the bullets fired by british soldiers. it is said that the firing was not indiscriminate – the soldiers shot only at the person who was walking with the flag. but as one brave student fell, another came forward to take his place and carry the flag further. in the end, there were seven dead students and around 14 were injured.
