khurma
khurma or shakarpara is a dessert made by deep-frying flour dumplings and then dipping them in a sugar syrup. when the sugar syrup dries, it crystallises on the fried dumplings, giving them a sweet, powdery outer covering. another version, called laktho, is made in the same way with rice flour and jaggery.
