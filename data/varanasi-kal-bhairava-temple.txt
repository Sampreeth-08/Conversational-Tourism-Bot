kal bhairava temple
kal bhairav temple, as is evident from the name, is dedicated to lord kal bhairav, the fiercest form of lord shiva. the main idol in the temple features a man wearing a garland with a skull for a face. a popular belief here is that kal bhairava decides who stays in varanasi, and perhaps that is why those coming to the city, first visit the temple, and those leaving stop here to take the god's permission. the entrance to the temple is narrow and one can see the deity from it. devotees like to offer sesame oil and flowers to the deity. the inner sanctum has a back entrance but only priests can access it. there are many shops lined outside the premises in case visitors need to buy offerings for the god.
