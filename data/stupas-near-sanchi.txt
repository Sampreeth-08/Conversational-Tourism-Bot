stupas-near-sanchi 
sonari, about 10 km from sanchi, contains a group of eight stupas which are home to many relics associated with buddhism. another location, satdhara, which is 11 km west of sanchi, is home to two more similar stupas. it takes an hour long drive to reach satdhara from sanchi. satdhara is located on a hill of rolling green, overlooking the halali river. coming here, one can easily imagine how the peace that permeates this place must have appealed to monks centuries ago. the largest stupa here, called stupa number 1, is almost as big as the famous sanchi stupa. other minor attractions nearby include the ancient ruins at andher and mural khurd, almost 17 and 12 km away from sanchi, respectively.
