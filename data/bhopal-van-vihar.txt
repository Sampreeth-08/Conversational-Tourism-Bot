van vihar
perched atop a hill near the beautiful upper lake, van vihar is an open zoological park that houses huge enclosures where animals like lion, tiger, bear, panther and hyena are kept. the carnivores are kept safely away from humans, but herbivores like blackbuck and cheetal are allowed to freely move around. while birds fill the air with incessant chirping, you can spot crocodiles and tortoises basking in the sun. a major attraction in van vihar is the reptile unit, where you can find snakes like python, russel's viper and cobra. there is a special section dedicated to a variety of insects and butterflies as well. since the park lies in close proximity to the upper lake, it plays host to migratory birds in winters. van vihar is an idyllic place to experience wildlife at close quarters. the park is best explored in a car or on a bike, and both are available for hire.
