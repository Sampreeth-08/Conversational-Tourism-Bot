from the 8th to the 16th centuries, the region of bhuj was ruled by the samma rajputs of sindh, who eventually conceded the region to the jadeja rajputs. it is said that the name of the city was inspired by bhujiyo dungar, a 160 m hill that looms over bhuj. the mughals took control of bhuj in the late 16th century. from 1741, under the leadership of lakhpatji i (king or rao of kutch), bhuj saw the installation of some of its most gorgeous architectural structures that stand even today. all of these factors ensured that bhuj and the rest of the kutch had a heterogeneous mix of language, culture and religion.
