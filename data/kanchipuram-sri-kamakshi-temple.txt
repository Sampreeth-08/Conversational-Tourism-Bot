sri kamakshi temple
the name kamakshi refers to goddess saraswati (goddess of education) and goddess lakshmi (goddess of wealth), where 'ka' means saraswati, 'ma' means lakshmi and 'akshi' means eye. the imposing temple is dedicated to goddess kamakshi (considered as the ultimate form of goddess parvati).
the deity of this temple is unique in that instead of the traditional standing position, her idol is in the yogic position of padmasana. she is seen holding a sugarcane bow and five flowers in the two of her lower arms, and a pasha (lasso), and an ankusha (goad) in her two upper arms. the goddess is flanked by the holy trinity (lord shiva, lord vishnu and lord brahma).
