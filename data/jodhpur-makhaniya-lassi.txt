makhaniya lassi
the deliciously thick makhaniya lassi can be the highlight of a foodie's trip to jodhpur. it is sweet and is topped with malai, a dollop of white butter and grated dry fruits. first, kesar or saffron is soaked in hot milk; then, curd, sugar and cardamom are blended together, and the kesar infusion is added to this mixture. the liquid is finally poured into a tall glass, and topped off with cream, nuts and unsalted butter. this cooling and delicious drink is a welcome respite during your travels in the desert state.
