vada pav
colloquially known as vada pav, it is a type of indian burger that is made from boiled potato stuffing dipped in gram flour batter and deep fried then served on a bun or a bread slice. it is relished by locals and tourists alike and is soul-food for maharashtrians. it is believed to be invented by ashok vaidya in 1966, who opened a small stall serving this snack, opposite to the dadar train station, in mumbai. thousands of workers often looking for a quick and cheap snack would flock to his stall. soon, vada pav became a hit with not just workers but most of the people of the state. today, almost every street corner of kolhapur has a vendor selling vada pav.
