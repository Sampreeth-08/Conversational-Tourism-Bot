mansar
lying on the outskirts of the city, mansar is a one-of-its-kind tourist stopover known for its archaeological excavations dating back to the 5th century. as you enter the gate of the archaeological site, you are welcomed by a huge mound. on reaching the top of the mound, you will come across a grid of excavated walls surrounding a sprawling pyramidal brick structure. you will be instantly reminded of the beautiful ruins of nalanda. on climbing further, you will get a spectacular view of lush green surroundings and the ramtek temple complex. the multi-storeyed brick structure stands at a height of 15 m and holds a plinth or adhisthana adorned with alternating niches. a sacrificial fire-pit can also be seen next to the massive structure. as you explore further, you will reach another majestic structure that served as the residence of the vakataka king, pravarasena ii (400-415 ce), and is known as pravarpura.
