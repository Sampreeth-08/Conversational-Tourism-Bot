gothsi (gochi)
this festival is celebrated by families in which a son was born the previous year. the ceremony involves four men lifting a dough of sattu (roasted barley) from a big plate and placing it in front of the deity. a young girl, dressed her best, accompanies these men while carrying a pot full of chhang, a local drink. two more men with sticks of pencil cedar and cedar leaves tied up in lambskin accompany her. the first woman to have given birth to a boy, decked up, also walks along. the village priest, called labdagpa, offers prayer with a bow and arrow. as the dough is broken up and thrown away to appease the gods, people beat drums and the lambskin is placed on a tree or bush and arrows are shot at it. the villagers then visit each house where a boy was born, and dancing and feasting continue late into the night.
