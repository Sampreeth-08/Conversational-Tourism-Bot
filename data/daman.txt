tucked away in india's western corner, daman is drenched in portuguese heritage and blessed with serene golden and black sand beaches. an idyllic natural retreat, nestled in the gulf of khambhat, the union territory has several quaint churches and ancient forts that exude an old-world charm and are fine specimens of the portuguese style of architecture. divided by the pristine daman ganga river into moti daman and nani daman that are both crowned with portuguese riches, daman is a quintessential tourist beach destination. take a walk down the lanes ofÂ  history at the modi daman fort or admire the awe-inspiring architecture of the churches or just relax at one of the beaches, there's much to do in daman. a visit to this beautiful erstwhile portuguese colony (16th century to 20th century) is sure to leave you rejuvenated.
