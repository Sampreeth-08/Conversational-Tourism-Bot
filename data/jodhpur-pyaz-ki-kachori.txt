pyaz ki kachori
pyaz-ki-kachori is a savoury snack that is stuffed with a mixture of onion, potato and dry fruits, along with red chilli powder, green chillies, and a host of indian masalas. the mixture is then deep fried till golden, and is best-consumed hot.
this kachori is an explosion of flavours in the mouth and is generally a sunday special breakfast in many households of jodhpur. light on the stomach but rich in taste, pyaz-ki-kachori is the ultimate appetiser for any occasion. it is served with a generous helping of mint or tamarind chutney, and is sometimes paired with aloo jeera or aloo methi. tea usually accompanies a plate of pyaz-ki-kachori.
