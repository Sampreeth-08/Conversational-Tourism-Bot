tanjore bobblehead dolls
apart from glass paintings, thanjavur's other ingenious craft is bobblehead dolls. these are very famous toys that have become a cultural symbol for india globally now. it is an old tradition in the city. the dolls are purely handcrafted, put together with materials like paper mache, wax, plaster of paris, clay and colouring agents. they are often made with terracotta and the end product is a fine, brightly-coloured toy that makes for a great souvenir to take back home. these dolls are usually 15 to 30 cm tall and their entire weight is concentrated on the bottom-most point. the base of the toy is used as the centre of gravity to help the doll oscillate easily. the authentic tamil name for the dolls is thanjavur thalayatti bommai, which originated in the 19th century under king saraboji, the last ruler of bhonsle dynasty. the dolls form part of display in tamilian households during navaratri (a holy nine-day festival). the bobblehead doll has another version to it known as the roundpot or rocking doll. the toy has been given the geographical indicator status by government of india, another honour for thanjavur.
