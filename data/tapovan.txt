tapovan 
the tapovan hills are located 10 km from deoghar and boast tapo nath mahadev, a temple of lord shiva. another attraction here is a cracked rock, in whose inner surface one can allegedly see the portrait of lord hanuman. this is particularly marvellous as it is almost impossible to insert a paint brush into the crack and draw anything. below the hill, there is a small kund (water body) and it is believed that goddess sita used to bathe in it. thus, it has been named as sukta kund or sita kund by local people. 
the word 'tapovan' means forest of meditation and in the past, it was a meditation spot (tapobhumi) for the nagas (sadhus). thus, it has been named tapovan.
