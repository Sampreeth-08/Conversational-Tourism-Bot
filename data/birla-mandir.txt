birla-mandir 
constructed with white marble from rajasthan, the spectacular birla mandir sits on a hillock called kala pahad, overlooking the hussain sagar lake. built in 1976, it is dedicated to lord vishnu in the form of sri venkateswara. the temple boasts a combination of utkal (odia) and south indian styles of architecture. the south indian style is represented by the rajagopuram (entrance gate) while the odia style is represented by the jagadananda vimanam tower. along with a temple dedicated to lord buddha, the birla mandir complex also houses shrines dedicated to lord shiva, lord ganesha, goddess saraswati, lord hanuman, lord brahma and goddess lakshmi. offering stunning views of the city, especially at dusk, its serene atmosphere calms the mind. lit up in the evening, it's an ethereal sight to behold.
