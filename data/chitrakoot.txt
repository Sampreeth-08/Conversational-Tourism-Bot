chitrakoot
description
poised along the banks of the pristine mandakini river, the peaceful pilgrim town of chitrakoot, that spreads over the states of uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh, is immersed in the devotion of lord rama, who is believed to have spent 11 and a half years of the 14 years of his exile here. according to the epic ramayana, chitrakoot is the place where bharat, brother of lord rama came to visit him and asked him to return to ayodhya to rule the kingdom.
sitting in the shadow of the scenic vindhya range of mountains, chitrakoot is speckled with ancient temples, ghats (stepped banks of a river), kunds (sacred ponds) and ashrams, almost all of which echo the tales of the hindu epic ramayana and recount legends of the mighty lord rama, who lived here with his wife sita and his brother lakshmana. given a large number of temples here, chitrakoot is flooded with devotees during festival season, who flock to the town to seek blessings of their god. due to its location next to the mandakini river, also known as river payasvini, several ghats have been built on the water's periphery, allowing pilgrims to bathe in the holy river, and participate in the arti (ritual) that takes place at the ghats in the evenings. the arti infuses the environment with devotional energy, allowing visitors to immerse themselves wholly in the spirit of chitrakoot. chitrakootâ€™s spiritual legacy dates back to several ages. it is said that goswami tulsidas, writer of ramcharitmanas, also spent a long time here. sage atri and sati anasuya are believed to have meditated in chitrakoot as well. many also believe that the supreme gods of hinduism (brahma, vishnu, and shiva) took incarnations here.
the name chitrakoot literally translates into a hill of many wonders, and the chitrakoot parvat mala (garland of mountains) includes pilgrimage sites as kamadgiri, hanuman dhara, janki kund, lakshman pahari, and devangana.
