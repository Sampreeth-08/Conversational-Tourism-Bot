ker-sangri
ker sangri originated from the arid land of rajasthan. ker, a shrub berry and sangri, a bean of a flowering tree called khejari, come together to make this easy-to-prepare dish. this vegetarian delicacy can be best enjoyed with bajara roti. ker sangri can be prepared in various ways with every variation making this dish even more delicious.
the use of whole, dried red chillies is known to enhance the taste of this dish, which is slightly sour, presumably from the raw mango powder. it has an earthy, deeply natural flavour. the stringy beans are cooked in yoghurt with cashews and raisins.
