nahargarh fort
built as a fortress and a stronghold to ward off enemy invasions, the impressive nahargarh fort marks the northern end of jaipur. sitting on a ridge in the aravalli range, the fort was constructed in 1734 and expanded in 1868. an interesting story says that the fort was named after a dead prince, nahar singh, whose restless spirit demanded that the structure be named after him. offering fantastic views of the city, the fort looks astounding at night, bathed in bright lights. the architecture of the fort is breathtaking in its majesty and one can see traces of indo-european styles. 'tadigate' is the entrance gate and to its left lies a temple dedicated to the gods of the rulers of jaipur. another temple inside the fort, dedicated to rathore prince, nahar singh bhomia, is also worth a visit.
