taj mahal
mughal emperor shah jahan, the creator of the taj mahal, said that the beauty of the monument made “the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes”. it has also been described as a “teardrop on the cheek of eternity” by nobel laureate rabindranath tagore. every year, thousands of tourists from around the world make a beeline for this breathtakingly ethereal marble monument, considerd by many as the most beautiful building constructed by man. the monument was built as a memorial by mughal emperor shah jahan for his deceased wife, mumtaz mahal. it is one of the seven wonders of the world and is a monument of pride for not just agra but also india.
a unesco world heritage site, it is featured in almost all literature about india and is one of the most enduring images of the country. its name is believed to have been drawn from the persian language: ‘taj’ means crown and ‘mahal’ means palace, thus making this the palace of the crown. interestingly, the queen it was built in memory of, originally named arjumand begum, held the name mumtaz mahal, which meant the crown of the palace. although it is best known as a symbol of love, a grieving emperor’s ode to his deceased queen, another legend sees the taj mahal as an embodiment of shah jahan’s vision of kingship. the story goes that he sought to build something akin to heaven on earth, a spectacular, unbelievably beautiful monument that reinforced the power as well as the perceived divinity of the monarch as next only to the almighty.
