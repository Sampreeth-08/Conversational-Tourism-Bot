baba atal rai tower
baba atal rai tower is situated to the south of the golden temple. at a height of 40 m, it is a nine-storeyed tower and one of the tallest buildings in amritsar. legend has it that atal rai, the son of the sixth guru hargobind, revived a dead friend, mohan. guru hargobind rebuked the nine-year-old child for displaying his spiritual powers. in order to compensate for breaking the law, atal rai took samadhi. each floor of this octagonal tower represents a year of atalâ€™s life. initially, the structure was built as a tower, but eventually, it was transformed into a gurudwara. the first floor of the tower houses a number of miniature works depicting scenes from guru nanak's life. one can also get a sweeping and panoramic view of the city of amritsar from the top of the tower.
