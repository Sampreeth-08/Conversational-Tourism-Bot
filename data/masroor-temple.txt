masroor-temple 
very rarely does one come across a temple as unique as the masroor temple, in himachal pradesh. popularly known as the himalayan pyramid, the temple complex is an important archaeological site dating back to the 8th and 9th centuries. it is a cluster of 15 rocks that have been carved out of a single rock. located 40 km west of kangra, this temple complex is popular for its distinguished architecture. as you enter the complex, you will be left mesmerised by the beautiful sight of the temple getting reflected in the masroor lake, located nearby. built in the shikhara (spire) style of architecture, the rock-cut temples are perched at a height of 2,500 ft above sea level. the 14 temples of the complex have been cut from the outside but the central one from the inside. the main sanctum sanctorum houses idols of lord rama, lord lakshmana and goddess sita. the temple complex is now known as thakurwada, which means vaishnavite temples. the walls, doors, lintels and spires boast intricate sculpting details as well as figurines of gods and goddesses. it is believed that the temple was originally dedicated to lord shiva as there is a figure of the deity on the central lintel. the temple shares a stark resemblance with the temples at cambodia's angkor wat, mumbai's elephanta caves and mahabalipuram.
