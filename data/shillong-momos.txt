momos
momos, of tibetan origin, are steamed dumplings made of wheat flour with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian filling. variants filled with cottage cheese, chicken or mutton are extremely popular and are best enjoyed with a spicy chutney, which is a blend of dried red chillies and vinegar. it is believed that momos came to shillong with the chinese community who settled here and introduced their food culture to the city. they are considered to be a part of the diet of arunachal pradesh's monpa and sherdukpa tribes, who live in the west kameng and tawang districts that share a border with tibet. the momos that are eaten here are generally stuffed with minced pork, mustard leaves and green vegetables and are served with a chilli paste.
