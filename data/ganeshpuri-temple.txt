ganeshpuri-temple 
once a dense forestland inhabited by a few tribal communities, ganeshpuri was transformed into a spiritual centre by spiritual leader, nityanand swami. the place has a shiva temple, a few natural hotwater springs and several other temples. of the many hot springs, a few are open to the public with bathhouses built around them. in its twin town, vajreshwari, the vajreshwari temple is quite significant. it is dedicated to goddess vajreshwari, who is an incarnation of goddess parvati. the temple was built by the peshwas after winning back the vasai fort from the portuguese. it is situated at the foothills of the mandakini hills, which were formed out of a volcanic eruption. this also explains the numerous mineral-rich springs in the area. a flight of fifty odd steps leads to the temple perched on the top of a small hillock.
