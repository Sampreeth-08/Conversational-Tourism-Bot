phodong monastery
set at a height of 4500 ft, giving a picture-perfect view of deep valleys and towering mountains, phodong monastery is one of the six most important monasteries in sikkim, built in the 18th century, circa 1740, by chogyal gyurmed namgyal, the then ruler of sikkim. it belongs to the karma kagyu sect of tibetan buddhism and houses beautiful paintings and murals.
the original structure was destroyed in an earthquake, and rebuilt by the lamas in 1977 with the help of government funds. the new building is bigger and grander than the old one. the old fresco paintings were extracted by the delhi national museum institute, and were preserved till they could be transported to the new monastery.
