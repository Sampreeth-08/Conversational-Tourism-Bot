udaipur
description
popularly known as the city of lakes, serene udaipur is the crowning jewel of royal rajasthan. with shimmering lakes visible from almost every rooftop, fairytale palaces, sprawling havelis, revered temples and narrow lanes weaving through colourful markets as ancient as the city's history, udaipur's charm is unmatched.founded by maharaja udai singh ii in 1559, the city served as the capital of the kingdom of mewar after mughal emperor akbar besieged its earlier power-centre chittorgarh. udaipur is also referred to as the venice of the east, a title it has earned for being dotted with numerous lakes (seven to be precise)! nestled in the mighty aravalli range, surrounded by dense forests and craggy hills, and magical sunrises and sunsets turning its lakes into pools of gold, udaipur is one of the most picturesque destinations in the country. colonel james tod of the east india company, who was also a scholar, aptly described the city as “the most romantic place in the indian sub continent”.
visitors can enjoy tranquil boating on lake pichola, the largest of udaipur's lakes, spend a day taking in the jaw-dropping opulence of city palace, visit the time-weathered temples, shop at the art and curio stalls that line the streets, enjoy rajasthani folk music and dance performances, taste mouth-watering cuisine or drive out of the city to discover legends hidden in the wooded aravalli hills and the impregnable forts dotting its surroundings. no wonder then, udaipur is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country!
