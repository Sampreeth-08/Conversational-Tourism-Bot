ram tirath
ram tirath is located 12 km west of amritsar and is believed to be the place where sage valmiki’s (the author of epic ramayana) ashram used to stand in ancient times. many believe that it was here that lord rama's sons, lav and kush, were born. it is said the hut where goddess sita gave birth to her sons still stands, along with sage valmiki’s abode. the major attractions are beautifully sculpted statues, depicting scenes from the ancient epic.
one will also find an ancient tank along with many temples. every year in november, starting on the full-moon night, there is a four-day fair held that invites visitors from around the region.
