udayagiri fort
udayagiri fort is one of the most prominent tourist stopovers in the city. also known as de lannoy’s fort or dillani kottai, it is a remnant of the regime of travancore. the fort is surrounded by an isolated hill about 260 high and was used as a training ground for the king’s army. remains of the furnace used for making ammunition stand as a testimony to the fact. interestingly, it is said that a brass gun, 16-ft-long, was found in the fort complex but could not be moved even a few feet by a number of people including 16 elephants. now, the fort has been turned into a natural park and one can find a tree house, herbal gardens, bird and deer enclosures and an aquarium.
