the lake palace
located at the heart of lake pichola, the ethereal lake palace seems like a mirage,  a dream in white floating in the brilliant blue of the lake. and every sunrise and sunset, the palace seems to melt into the molten gold of the shimmering waters.
built on a four-acre jag niwas island between 1743 and 1746 under the supervision of maharana jagat singh ii as his summer palace, this white marble palace was originally known as jag niwas. later, it was used as the summer resort by the descendants of jagat singh. today, it houses a five-star hotel.
