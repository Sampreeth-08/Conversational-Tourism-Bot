legend has it that a group of dwarf sages worshipped lord shiva in darukavana. lord shiva appeared before them as a nude ascetic wearing only serpents on his body, to test their devotion and patience. on seeing the saint, the wives of the sages got attracted to him and left their husbands behind, which angered the sages. they lost their patience and cursed the ascetic to lose his linga. a shivling fell on earth leaving the entire world shaken. when lord brahma and lord vishnu requested lord shiva to save the earth and take his linga back, lord shiva accepted their request and promised that he will be forever present in darukavana as a jyotirlinga.
