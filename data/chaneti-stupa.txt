chaneti-stupa 
the ruins of the ancient baked-brick chaneti stupa are said to be dating back to the mauryan period when the city of shrughna (now sugh) was under the rule of emperor ashoka. 
according to an account given by the chinese pilgrim hiuen tsang, sugh was home to a number of important stupas as well as a monastery. the village of chaneti lies about 3 km north-west of sugh, and it is highly likely that the stupa at chaneti was among the ones referred to by hiuen tsang. the architectural style of this stupa, formed by concentric layers to create a hemisphere, corresponds with shahpur and dharmarajika stupas at taxila. when constructed, the stupa was most probably surrounded by a wooden railing as no trace of a stone railing has been found. the kushana period saw the construction of four shrines in four directions near the old circumambulatory path (pradakshina path). a new pathway was also built underneath to walk around it. this is the only place in india where shugna period terracotta figures of vaanara (monkey) have been found. archaeological pieces of evidence have suggested that this was an important trade juncture on the uttarapath, which lay on the banks of the yamuna river. according to the travel records of the chinese traveller hiuen tsang, the village was big enough and important enough to be home to about a 100 hindu temples, 10 stupas and five monasteries.
