khajuraho 
brahma-temple 
on the southern end of khajur lake lies the first of the three hindu temples. it is named after lord brahma as the four-faced linga here is said to represent the creator of the world, brahma. however, the image of lord vishnu above the sanctorum door shows that it was originally dedicated to him. though it is smaller in size compared to nearby temples, it has a robust granite structure and stands on a square plan that has a sanctum and no mandaps (outdoor pillared halls). the temple is estimated to belong to 900 ad. 
the walls of the structure have been carved intricately with figurine work and its roof resembles that of the larger temples - instead of being in shikhara (spire) style, it is pyramidal.
