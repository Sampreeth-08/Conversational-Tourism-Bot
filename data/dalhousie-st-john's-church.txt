st john's church
the oldest church in dalhousie, st johnâ€™s church was constructed by protestant missionaries in 1863. the church's construction is consistent with the victorian-era architecture of 19th century british buildings employing wood and bricks. perfectly positioned at about 2 km from the main bus-stand in dalhousie, the church is also home to a library that has been maintained in an almost pristine condition with informative and detailed books about the history and geography of the region. tourists can also find rare archival photographs in the library that take one through the rich and eventful history of the entire town of dalhousie. the sunday mass is quite a favourite here and is attended by devotees that flock to the church in large numbers.
