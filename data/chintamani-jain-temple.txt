chintamani-jain-temple 
chintamani jain temple is one of the oldest temples in surat that was built about 400 years ago. it draws visitors not only for its spiritual significance but also for its architectural beauty. the temple was built under the reign of mughal emperor, aurangzeb, at the end of the 17th century. it has simple exteriors, but its beautifully carved interiors more than make up for it. the wooden pillars in the temple are covered with gorgeous vegetable dye paintings and are topped with carved brackets that make for a fascinating sight. the vegetable dye paintings of jain preacher, acharya hemchandra, and king kumarpala, of the chaulukya dynasty, are notable. the temple's popularity can be estimated by the fact that the london museum also houses a sandalwood replica of it.
