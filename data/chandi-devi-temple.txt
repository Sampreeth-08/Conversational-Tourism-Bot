situated on top of the neel parwat, the chandi devi temple is dedicated to goddess chandi devi.  the main statue was established by adi shakaracharya in the 8th century ad, while the temple was constructed by suchat singh, the king of kashmir, in 1929 ad. from chandighat, one needs to trek 3 km to reach the temple, or take a trolley on the ropeway.  legend has it that once demon kings shumbh and nishumbh had taken over lord indra’s ancient kingdom and had thrown the gods out of the heavens. chandika devi, a goddess who was created with the cells from goddess parvati’s body, was desired by king shumbh. when she refused his advances, the kings sent their army chiefs chanda and munda to kill goddess chandika. however, chanda and munda were killed by kalika devi, who was born out of goddess chandika’s anger. chandika devi went on to kill the two demon kings as well. tired after this long battle, the goddess is said to have rested on neel parwat and the chandi devi temple was built in her honour.
