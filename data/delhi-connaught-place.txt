connaught place
the heartbeat of delhi, connaught place is a heritage neighbourhood that has been modeled after the georgian style of architecture. lined with a host of eateries, high-end stores, parlours, theatres and book stores, the market is the hub of most activities in delhi. spread in two concentric circles, connaught place holds a vintage character that is vividly contrasted by various cosmopolitan shops and cafes that are crowned with blaring neon signs. on any good day, you can see a number of students and office workers spilling out on the streets and enjoying the pleasant weather while relishing a plate of chaat from a vendor.
before stalls and stores took over connaught place, it used to be a cinema centre. in the 1920s, russian ballets, urdu plays and silent films were hosted at various theatres here. its heritage cinemas like rivoli and odeon still preserve their antiquity and it is an enchanting experience to catch a movie in one of the sprawling movie theatres.
