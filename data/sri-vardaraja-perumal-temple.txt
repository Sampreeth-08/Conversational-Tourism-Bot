sri-vardaraja-perumal-temple 
built by the rulers of vijayanagar, the varadharaja perumal temple is dedicated to lord vishnu. it is one of the divya desam temples, the 108 temples said to have been visited by the 12 poet saints or alwars. 
there are a number of other temples in the complex. the main temple has a 100-pillar hall, which has some beautiful exquisitely carved sculptures. the idol of lord athi varadaraja perumal, 40 ft long and made of athi wood, is seen in a reclining position. this statue is brought out only once every 40 years for darshan (sighting). the raja gopuram (main gateway) is a feast to the eyes, soaring to a height of 96 ft. 
over 350 inscriptions from the chola, pandya, telugu choda, kandavaraya, cheras, kaaktiya, sambuvaraya, hoysala and vijayanagara dynasties can also be viewed here. lizards engraved in stone and plated with gold can be seen in the temple complex. 
four services are held by priests who are believed to be the descendants of yagna valkyar. while festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm here, the vaikasi brahmmotsavam, observed for 10 days, beginning on the poornima vishaka day, is the most spectacular. the purattasi navaratri festival also goes on for 10 days, and is quite the show at the temple.
