mawlynnong
one of the cleanest villages in india, mawlynnong is located about 92 km from shillong. in 2003, it won the acclaim for being the cleanest village in asia and another for being the cleanest in india in 2005. the village is locally referred to as 'god's own garden' and is commended for its community-based eco-tourism initiative. under this, the onus of keeping the village clean lies on every resident and to promote cleanliness, bamboo garbage bins dot the lanes, nooks and corners of mawlynnong. the waste collected in the bins is sent to a pit and turned into manure. smoking is prohibited here and so is plastic. rainwater harvesting is considered very important and is practised by almost all its residents. in addition, the village boasts a 100 per cent literacy rate and most of the inhabitants are fluent in english. since it is located on the indo-bangla border, one can enjoy a sweeping view of bangladesh. another reason to mark this place in your itinerary is the natural rock balancing phenomenon that is seen here - the unusual and curious sight of one boulder balanced on another. tourists can also enjoy a trek to a single-decker living root bridge here.
