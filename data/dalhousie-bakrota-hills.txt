bakrota hills
lying on the outskirts of dalhousie, bakrota hills are among the most picturesque spots in the hill town. surrounded by enchanting snow-clad mountains and scenic panoramas, they sit at an altitude of roughly 2,085 m above sea level. one important attraction is the bakrota mall, a cobblestoned boulevard that is best suited for a leisurely stroll while taking in the beauty of the landscape, particularly the majestic himalayan mountains. as the soft rays of the sun are filtered through the oak, pine and deodar trees, the entire region glows with an ethereal charm. some of the best views of the vistas can be had from barkota mall. the best time to visit is during the winter months when the hills are covered in a soft layer of snow and boast clear skies with unobstructed views of the mighty himalayan peaks.
