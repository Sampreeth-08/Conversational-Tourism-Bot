sardar samand lake palace
located on the banks of the pristine sardar samand lake, sardar samand lake palace was constructed by maharaja umaid singh in 1933 as a hunting lodge. even after decades, it remains the preferred abode of royal families and travellers as it has now been converted into a hotel. the resort itself is like a lesson in rajasthans history, featuring an exquisite collection of original watercolour paintings and african trophies. the palace has its own oriental garden, boat-house, swimming pool, and tennis and squash courts. thus, you can relax and rejuvenate, without a care in the world, as all your needs are attended to.
