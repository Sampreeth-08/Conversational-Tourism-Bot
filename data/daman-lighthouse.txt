lighthouse
the moti daman fort houses two beautiful lighthouses that stand as a testament to daman's rich portuguese heritage. these are popularly known as the old lighthouse and the new lighthouse. while the old one was built by the portuguese, the indian government constructed the new lighthouse. visitors can, however visit only the old lighthouse, which is just a storey tall. a winding spiral staircase leads you to the top of the old lighthouse that offers a picturesque view of the vast sea. entry to the new lighthouse is banned due to security reasons but tourists can still admire its unique architecture. built close to the old lighthouse, the new lighthouse has a revolving tower and a 204 m diameter lantern on the top.
