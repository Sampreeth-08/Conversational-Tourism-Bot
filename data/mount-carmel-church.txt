munnar 
mount-carmel-church 
boasting colonial architecture and exquisite artworks, the mount carmel church is among the most popular spiritual attractions in munnar. nestled in the hills of munnar, it is the first roman catholic church in these ranges, and was established in 1898. a pastel-hued edifice set amidst rolling green hills, the church is known for its pretty wood-framed windows and the main shrine that houses an elegant statue of christ and the virgin mary. from the terrace of the building, tourists can breathe in spectacular views of verdant hills, lush valleys, emerald tea plantations and pristine rivers. 
 
the church has been a silent witness to munnar's transformation as a plantation region to a major tourist destination. it was established by father alphonse of the spanish missionary, who was buried here after he died in 1916. his successor fr blasius, ocd, continued his work; fr blasius was followed by fr salustin, ocd, who built the grotto in 1938. the grotto is standing till today. the holy mass is held here every day at 7:30 am, and is attended by hundreds of devotees from neighbouring villages.
