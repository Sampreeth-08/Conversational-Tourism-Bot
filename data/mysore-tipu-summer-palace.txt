tipu summer palace
also known as dariya daulat bagh (translating to garden of the sea of wealth), the summer palace of tipu sultan was built in 1784 ad. based on indo-islamic architectural style, the palace is majorly built in teakwood and located on the banks of river cauvery, just outside tipu's fort. wooden pillars stand on the edges of the plinth. two wings of the palace have recessed bays with pillars supporting the roof. there are four simple staircases, built adjacent to the four partition walls that divide the audience hall into four rooms at the corners. there is also a central hall connecting the eastern and western corridors. what makes the palace truly spectacular though, is that almost every inch of the it is covered in frescoes that resemble mysore paintings.
