thiruvanaikaval
also known as thiruvanaikoil, thiruvanaikaval, a stoneâ€™s throw from the city, is home to the jambukeswarar-akilandeswari temple. dedicated to lord shiva, the temple is one of the panchabhoota sthalam (shrines representing one of the five elements of nature) and represents water. legend has it that once an elephant worshipped a shivling under a jambu tree by cleaning it with water from its trunk and thus got the name of jambukeswara. the shivling is reportedly submerged in water flowing from a spring into the sanctum. the temple is similar in architecture to the sri ranganatha swamy temple with concentric rectangular enclosures housing various deities. the jambukeswarar temple is defined by five enclosures that are surrounded by a 25-ft-high wall, marking the temple's precinct.
