needlecraft
a centuries-old craft, pine needle basket-weaving is done by coiling and braiding pine needles to make different products. villages of jadi paani, saur and rani chauri are famous for needlecraft. after the fall season, pine trees shed needles which locals collect. these are conventionally gathered from places where no one has walked to ensure they are unbroken. these are collected either by hand or a garden fork. they are then soaked overnight in water so that they become pliable and soft and it is easier to bend them when they are sewn or coiled. depending on the product being made, the needlesâ€™ knob or fascicle on one end is left as it is or removed. weaving, coiling and braiding are the three most common techniques used to make products like coasters, glass-holders, table mats, baskets and jewellery items. the needles are coloured dark brown and yellow using local plants like hinsar, jinjaroo, thermole and hingloda.
