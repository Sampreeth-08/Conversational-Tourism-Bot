kibber
lying at a height of 4,205 m above sea level, kibber used to be the highest village in the region and was permanently inhabited and connected by a motorable road. this scenic and mountaineous village is known for its natural beauty and monasteries. many say that the landscape of kibber resembles that of tibet and ladakh and thus its beauty lies in its barren splendour. the famous ki monastery, which is the largest monastery in the valley, lies very close to the village.
the village is home to a civil dispensary, a high school, a post office, a telegraph office and a community tv set. the 80 houses in the village all use stone instead of mud or bricks for construction. it is located 8 km from ki village and 16 km from kaza, and is a base for several high-altitude treks. another attraction here is the kibber sanctuary that lies a little beyond the village and is spread over a 1,400 sq km area. this sanctuary is the only one in india that is located in a cold desert and one can find blue sheep and ibex here. kibber is also one of the most fossiliferous regions in the country and a great place to learn about times past.
