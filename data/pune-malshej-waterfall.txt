malshej waterfall
nestled in the picturesque sahyadri range, the beautiful malshej waterfall lies near malshej ghat. while the surrounding scenic beauty is enchanting, the spot is a great trekking point. the rugged hills with several forts, temples and ancient caves make for an interesting route for explorers. during the monsoon months (from july to september), this waterfall is a marvel of sorts, when it flows in its full glory. close by is the pimpalgaon lake, where visitors can catch a quiet and tranquil moment. a short distance away from the lake, the lenyadri caves and shivneri fort are located. given the abundance of tourist attractions here, it is the preferred getaway for the folks of pune and mumbai. there are some options for accommodation as well, in case you want to plan a longer stay.
