a visit to nathatop
a short trek from patnitop takes one to natha top, which remains covered in snow during winters. it is a good place for skiing and is also known for paragliding. situated at an altitude of 2,711 m, the kishtwar range of the himalayas is visible from natha top, as is the brammah massif, which comprises the well-known peaks of flat top, arjuna, and brammah i and ii.
the interesting thing about these peaks is that brammah ii is the highest of the lot, despite its name suggesting otherwise. however, brammah i is definitely the most dramatic, rising theatrically from the western edge from a lower base.
