ajmer
description
encircled by the craggy aravalli hills that overlook the scenic expanse of the ana sagar lake, the city of ajmer, nestled in rajasthan, is a symphony of diverse religions and cultures. a popular stopover for pilgrims, it is renowned as the home of ajmer-e-sharif, the dargah (a shrine built over a grave) of khwaja muin-ud-din chishti, the founder of the chishti order, the main sufi sect in india. while the dargah draws devotees all year round, it looks resplendent during the festival of ramadan and on the death anniversary of the saint, when a sea of people arrive to pay homage.
being the erstwhile seat of the chauhan kings, who established the city, ajmer is speckled with grand forts, ancient temples and a vibrant history that can be seen in its arts and crafts. the city is also the gateway to the town of pushkar, which is considered a major hindu pilgrimage spot. sprawled around the serene pushkar lake, with a dramatic landscape of sand dunes, lakes, hills and forests, pushkar is noted for its famous fair held during the months of october and november that draws more than 2,00,000 footfalls.
ajmer boasts a richly woven history, from when it founded by raja ajaypal chauhan to when prithviraj chauhan was killed by muhammad of ghor in the 12th century. it was later conquered by the marwar dynasty in 1532, followed by the rule of mughal dynasty under akbar in 1559. it was emperor akbar who gave ajmer the status of a full-fledged province. mughals continued to rule ajmer until 1770 when it was surrendered to the marathas. finally, in 1818 ajmer was passed on to the east india company by the marathas.
