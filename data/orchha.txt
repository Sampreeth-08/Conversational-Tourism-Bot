orchha
description
beguiling temples, monuments lost in history and an abundance of folklore make orchha a jewel in the crown of the state of madhya pradesh. this small, pastoral town is popularly known as raja ram's kingdom, maybe the only place in the country where lord rama is revered as a beloved king and not just a god. boasting an amazing blend of mughal and rajput architecture dating back to the 16th century, orchha was at the heart of many prominent royal dynasties for nearly 300 years. this history lives on in the splendid monuments that punctuate the quaint town shrouded in mystery and sitting by the softly flowing betwa river. add to this the sweet smell of custard apples permeating the air, and you may start to unravel the mesmeric charm of this “hidden place” (the meaning of orchha).
at the heart of orchha's heritage is the orchha fort complex. situated on an island in the betwa, this complex is a maze of palaces, forts and temples. divided into three parts: raj mahal, jahangir mahal and sheesh mahal, the fort hides within it secret passages, exquisite murals and resplendent residential quarters of kings and queens. orchha was established as the capital of the powerful bundelkhand empire by king rudra pratap singh in 1501 ad and then ruled by several kings. interestingly, here the betwa splits into seven channels, also known as satdhara. legend says that this is in honour of the seven erstwhile rulers of orchha. also honouring its royals are the intricately carved chhatris or cenotaphs, which are iconic of the city itself.
