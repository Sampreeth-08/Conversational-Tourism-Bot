butter chicken
this delectable staple of most non-vegetarians originated at the moti mahal, darya ganj in the 1950s. the story goes that the place was already popular among tandoori chicken lovers. the cooks at the restaurant were in a habit of recycling the leftover chicken juices by adding butter and tomato to them. once, this sauce was tossed with pieces of tandoori chicken. thus was born the decadent butter chicken that sets mouths drooling all over the world. it is creamy with thick, red tomato gravy and tastes slightly sweet. the dish almost melts in the mouth as the juice percolates into the chicken pieces making them juicy and tender. it is best tried with naan or roti (indian flatbread).
