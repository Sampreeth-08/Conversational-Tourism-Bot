kumbalgarh 
neelkanth-mahadev-temple 
neelkanth mahadev temple is famous for its 6-ft-high monolith shivling, which is made out of a single black kasoti stone. residing in the complex of the kumbhalgarh fort, the temple was built in 1458 and was renovated by rana sanga (a rajput king in the 16th century), who was a great worshipper of lord shiva. legend has it that rana sanga was so tall that when he sat to offer prayers, his eyes were on the same level as the shivling. an interesting feature about the temple is the fact that it has entrances from all the four directions and houses a sanctum and an open-pillared mandapa. a pillar on the left of the temple bears inscriptions that tell about the renovations done by rana sanga.
