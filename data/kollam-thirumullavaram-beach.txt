thirumullavaram beach
the crystal clear waters and golden sand of this unspoilt beach draw touristsÂ  looking for a peaceful and refreshing experience. undoubtedly, kollam's most popular beach, thirumullavaram is your best bet to witness breathtaking views of sunrise and sunset. around one-and-a-half kilometre into the sea is nyarazhcha para or the sunday rock, which is a rock floating on water, and can be seen from the beach when water recedes during low tide. not-to-be-missed is the mahavishnu temple where lord vishnu is worshipped as the presiding deity. located on the outskirts of kollam, this secluded beach is one of the safest beaches. the low tides at the beach allow children to swim and play around the water making it an ideal place to enjoy a vacation.
