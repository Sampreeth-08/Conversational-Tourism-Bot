desserts and sweets
when it comes to desserts and sweets, delhi is no less than a culinary treasury. for something rich and sweet, start with rabdi faluda, which is a thick creamy milk drink served with vermicelli noodles. kulfi, a flavoured frozen dessert should be on the list if one is looking for a lightly sweet or even a refreshing end to a meal. flavours of cool and juicy anar (pomegranate), aromatic kesar, pista, rose, banana, mango are some of the choices. if one is looking to dig into some chilly evening snacking, piping hot jalebis are just the thing. a sweet made by deep-frying batter in a pretzel-like shape and then soaking it in syrup, jalebis can also be eaten with rabdi faluda. another delicacy is daulat-ki-chaat that is made from the froth of churned milk. it is light and fluffy and is garnished with pistachios. a sweet made in almost every indian household during festive occasions, kheer is a must-try on your visit to delhi. a delicious rice pudding made with sugar and boiling milk, kheer can be served both hot and cold. donâ€™t forget to gorge on the sweet fruit cream that is topped with slices of fruits. for sweets prepared in pure desi ghee (clarified butter), one should try some helpings of sohan halwa (a dense sweet confection), pista samosa (fried pastry stuffed with pistachios) and badam barfi (sweetmeat made with almonds).
