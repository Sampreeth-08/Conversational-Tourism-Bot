mekedatu
mekedatu makes for a great one-day trip from bengaluru and is visited by a large number of city-dwellers and tourists for its unique sight of river cauvery cascading through a narrow gorge. bordered by lush green landscape, the river flows through a narrow and deep ravine of hard granite rocks. a prime spot here is the sangam, the confluence of rivers arkavathi and cauvery. tourists can also visit the beautiful sangameshwara temple, which is flocked by devotees throughout the year. other important attractions in mekedatu include shivasamudram falls and kallahalli sri srinivasa temple. the word mekedatu means goat's lap in kannada. the place was so named because the gorge through which river cauvery flows is so narrow that even a goat could leap over it. the best time to visit mekedatu is during the winter season.
