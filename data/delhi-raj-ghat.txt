raj ghat
built in the memory of mohandas karamchand gandhi, who is revered as the father of the nation, raj ghat is a marble platform where he was cremated on january 31, 1948. lying on the banks of the yamuna river, rajghat is fringed by lush well-manicured lawns that are dotted with trees. the mortal remains of gandhiji were cremated at this ghat.
the samadhi is a true reflection of the man himself and exudes a simplicity that he came to be associated with. a brick platform where his body was burned and a black marble platform are surrounded by a marble fence. the words 'he ram', which was the last thing gandhiji said, have been inscribed on the memorial. an eternal flame stands adjacent to it.
