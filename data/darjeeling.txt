the word ‘darjeeling’ comes from the tibetan words, ‘dorje’ meaning thunderbolt and ‘ling’ meaning land. thus, darjeeling is referred to as the land of the thunderbolt. before being acquired by the east india company in 1835, darjeeling was a part of sikkim and nepal for a while. initially, the city was ruled by the kings of sikkim, who were engaged in wars against the gorkhas, or the native warriors clan. after captain lloyd of the british government was stationed in the area, he was so much attracted by the beauty of the hills that he immediately proposed to build a sanatorium. thus, started the colonial influence in darjeeling. serving as the summer retreat of the british in the mid-19th century, darjeeling grew in importance.
