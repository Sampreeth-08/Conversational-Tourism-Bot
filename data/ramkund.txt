ramkund 
ramkund is a square stepwell, about 56 ft on one side, whose walls have carved miniature idols depicting the 10 incarnations of lord vishnu and sculptures ofÂ  lord rama, devi sita, lord lakshmana and lord hanuman. the architecture of the stepwell is geometrical and leaves one in awe of the skill of that time. as you descend down the steps to reach the water, you are engulfed by a sudden coolness that is not to be found above the stepwell. while going deeper into the well, one can almost be transported to the ancient times when it was a place of water storage. ramkund is located across the kutch museum and behind the ram dhun temple.
