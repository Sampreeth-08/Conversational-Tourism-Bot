mechuka
mechuka, colloquially known as menchukha, is a small town in arunachal pradesh that lies 6,000 ft above sea level, surrounded by pine trees and bushes. it is one of the lesser explored valleys in this himalayan region and thus unspoilt. the main attraction is the 400-year-old samten yongcha monastery of mahayana buddhist sect. it houses numerous ancient statues, including that of guru padmasambhava, considered to be founder of the nyingma sect. colourful costumes and masks created for folklore figures found in tibetan mythology can also be seen. these masks are often worn during a traditional dance called cham, which is an energetic and lively event that teaches people to shun all that is dark within them and embrace the good tenets of life according to buddhism, like compassion and love. many tibetan festivals, especially losar, are celebrated with reverence. the losar festival, celebrated to mark the auspicious start of a new year, sees a lot of visitors who come to offer prayers.
