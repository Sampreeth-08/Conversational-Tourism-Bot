puri 
narendra-sarovar 
located on the north-east of the jagannath temple, narendra sarovar is the largest of puris holy ponds or tanks. also called sri chandana pukur, it is the place where legend says lord jagannath comes during the annual chandan yatra (held in april-may) for nauka lila (boating excursion). the chandan yatra (sandalwood voyage) also marks the beginning of the grand rath yatra (chariot procession). during the yatra, thousands of devotees take a dip in the tank as they believe it would wash away their sins. a small island at the centre of the tank houses a temple dedicated to lord jagannath and his siblings, lord balabhadra and goddess subhadra. during the festival, beautifully decorated boats are used for taking the lord around the tank. as the boats do rounds of the waterbody, devotees throng its banks, dancing and singing.
