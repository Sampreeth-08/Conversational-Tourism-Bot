riang
the traditional dresses worn by the members of the riang community are quite simple. while the men wear a traditional handwoven loin cloth with a piece of cloth wrapped around the upper body, women wear a long cloth known as mnai, which resembles a wrap-around. to cover the upper half of their bodies, women wear the rikatouh. the colourful fabrics used in these dresses are usually woven by the women of the community.
