kumbhalgarh-fort 
the impregnable kumbhalgarh fort, sitting on a high mountain ridge seems like an impression from the past. soaring above the surrounding rugged mountainscape, at 3,600 ft, the fort can been seen much before one arrives at its foot. with the second-longest wall in the world, about 38 km long, the kumbhalgarh fort is recognised as a unesco world heritage site. also, known as the mewar fortress, it was the birthplace of the great rajput king, maharana pratap. everything about the fort has been built to fend off the enemy. from its high position in the aravalli hills and its strong ramparts to the four main gates of aaret, hanuman, hulla and ram pol, and the badal mahal, which was a great hindering force for the enemy, the fort was almost inaccessible. moreover, the surrounding 13 mountain peaks and numerous watchtowers made it more of a challenge for the enemy. historical records suggest that it was only once that the fort was besieged. exploring the fort is an unforgettable experience. from its high vantage points, which provide sweeping views of the thar desert, to its beautiful interiors and various sections like the badal mahal and the kumbh mahal, there's much to see. there are as many as 360 hindu and jain temples inside the fort and devotees can pay obeisance at them. tourists can also catch the light and sound show organised at the fort under the glittering stars. the fort was built by rana kumbha in the 15th century. it was renovated by maharana fateh singh in the 19th century. the tourism department of the state government organises a three-day festival to pay a tribute to rana kumbha for this splendid architecture.
