exerting a magnetic pull over scuba divers, snorkellers and nature lovers, the 4,200-sq-km of immaculate archipelago lagoons, warm waters and unspoilt coral reefs, make kavaratti, the capital of lakshadweep, one of the most attractive island destinations in the country. lying 300 km off the coast of the state of kerala, in the arabian sea, lakshadweep, the smallest union territory of india, is stunning in its remoteness. encompassing a string of about 36 palm-fringed coral islands, of which around 10 are inhabited, lakshadweep is nestled amidst deep blue lagoons that are spectacular in their beauty.
boasting an equally splendid flora and fauna, the waters come alive with schools of fish that seem like vibrant dots of colour swimming in the sea. from exploring shipwrecks that look like a virtual underwater museum to exploring the colourful marine life and indulging in various water sports like kayaking, windsurfing, canoeing, scuba diving and swimming, tourists can have their fill of nature's bounty in kavaratti. in the lagoons around it, one can spot fascinating starfish, anemones, sea cucumbers, corals amongst a multitude of fish. not just nature's paradise but also a spiritually significant place, kavaratti has the maximum number of mosques in lakshadweep. out of 52 mosques, jamnath, mohidden and ujra are the most prominent ones. kavaratti also offers great food choices to visitors and spicy tuna fish, sweet potatoes and chicken, made in malabar style, are a must try.
