three-hillocks 
visakhapatnam is home to three scenic hillocks that stand testament to the communal harmony that india is known for. it is a fascinating experience to get to the three hillocks as one gets to visit a temple, a mosque and a church during the same trip. the ross hill is home to the ross hill church while the sringamani hillock and the dargah konda hillock are home to the venkateswara temple and the baba ishaq madina dargah, respectively. the temple is said to be two centuries old while the mosque has been there for as many as 700 years. the magnificent church at ross hill is more than a century old and its impressive white building stands as a fine specimen of gothic architecture. the hilltops provide splendid views of visakhapatnam and the port channel. the entrance of the inner harbour for ships and liners can also be seen.
