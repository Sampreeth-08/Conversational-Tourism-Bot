weaving
weaving here is almost exclusively done by monpa women. girls are trained in the art of weaving from a very early age and the art form is handed down from generation to generation. the basic raw materials used by them in weaving are wool and cotton yarn. they weave woolen items of clothing, blankets, tents, etc., from yak hair. the woolen carpets woven by monpa women are exquisite. by combining different shades of woolen yarn, they weave carpets with gorgeous designs of dragon, snow lions, birds or flowers on them. equally sophisticated and artistic are their textile bags, which are made by combining five colours - red, yellow, white, black and green.
