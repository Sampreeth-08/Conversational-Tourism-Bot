panchapandava mandapam
another jewel in the mamallapuram unesco world heritage site complex is the panchapandava mandapam. one of the largest cave temples in the town, it was built between the 7th and 8th centuries, under king narasimhavarman i of the pallava dynasty. a fine example of rock-cut style architecture, this cave temple is a rectangular structure supported by pillars. its entrance is guarded by two seated lions and upon walking further, one can see lion bases on the columns of the verandah. behind a few columns on the inside ramp are hidden lions and elephants, and visitors can enjoy the challenge of spotting them out. the frontage of the cave has six lion-based pillars as well, providing it an all-over royal look. there are intricate carvings on all of the walls within the cave, on the pillars, on the columns in the verandah, and the rock-cut chambers, which make for interesting detailing.
