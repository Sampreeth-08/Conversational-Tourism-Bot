aurangabad
description
named after mughal emperor aurangzeb, the city of aurangabad is speckled with beautiful and legendary monuments, a legacy of the mughals, who reigned from here in 1653. from the marvellous bibi-qa-maqbara, a replica of the world-famous taj mahal, to the formidable daulatabad fort, aurangabad is steeped in history that is evident in its glorious ancient structures. lying in close proximity to the unesco world heritage sites of ajanta and ellora caves, aurangabad serves as a good base to explore the state of madhya pradesh.Â even though its history dates back to the earliest periods of indian civilisation, its true splendour was unravelled during the reign of the last great mughal emperor, aurangzeb.
