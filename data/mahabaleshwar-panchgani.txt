panchgani
located on the periphery of mahabaleshwar, the stunning hill station of panchgani is one of the most prominent attractions of the area. overlooking the pristine dhom dam lake, which is created by the krishna river, it is the meeting point of five hills of the sahyadri range, and is thus called panchgani. the five hills are topped by table land, the second-highest volcanic plateau in asia that was formed due to pressure between the earth plates and is well-known for its scenic beauty. paragliding is a popular activity here because of the picturesque views that few other places can match. panchgani is known for strawberry cultivation and jam is one of the best buys here. visitors can sit by the farms, where cafes and restaurants have been set up, and savour not only desserts, but yummy pizzas, pastas and other dishes while enjoying the fresh air. crushes, candies and other products can also be purchased here.
