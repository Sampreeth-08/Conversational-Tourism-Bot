srinagar 
shankaracharya-temple 
dedicated to lord shiva, the shankaracharya temple is situated on the gopadari hill, southeast of srinagar. this temple, believed to be one of the oldest shrines in the kashmir valley, is named after the great philosopher, shankaracharya, who visited the valley about 10 centuries ago. the temple, situated at a height of 1,100 ft above the city of srinagar, is constructed on a high octagonal plinth and can be approached using a flight of steps. 
 
like most temples of lord shiva, this one too represents the lord in phallic or linga form. the idol is encircled by a snake and has been made of reddish black stone, which was revived from the valley of river narmada in madhya pradesh. open between 7 am and 8 pm, the temple holds arti (a holy fire ritual) in the mornings and evenings. the festival of mahashivaratri is celebrated here with full fervour.
