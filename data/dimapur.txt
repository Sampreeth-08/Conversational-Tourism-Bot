dimapur
description
flanked by the pristine and softly flowing river dhansiri on one side and beautiful forested meadows on the other, the charming city of dimapur, in nagaland, is an unexplored and unspoilt destination. steeped in mellow serenity, dimapur was the ancient capital of the powerful kachari tribe and is speckled with ancient ruins of monoliths, temples, baths and embankments, all of which trace the town's historical roots to the 13th century ad.
meaning the city near a great river, dimapur acts as the gateway to parts of nagaland and manipur, and also reflects the tribal culture of these two states. while parts of the city are bustling commercial centres, others are endowed with lush meadows, resembling the setting of a hill station. surrounded by dense forests, gushing waterfalls and towering mountains, dimapur is an ideal choice for adventure lovers and solace seekers alike. there are several places of historical interest in and around the city, like the kachari rajbari fort ruins, and remnants of tanks like rajpukhuri, padampukhuri, bamunpukhuri, jorpukhuri etc.
