dada harir vav
the octagonal-shaped dada harir vav or stepwell is located in asarwa village, between a residential area on one side and coal yards of ahmedabad on the other. it is around 15 km from ahmedabad. a sanskrit inscription claims that the stepwell was built in december 1499 ad during the reign of mahmud shah and cost 3,29,000 mahmudis (inr 3 lakh) back then. it was apparently built by a household lady of  mahmud begada, dhai harir, as claimed by a persian inscription in the stepwell. then, it was locally known as dhai harir vav. the name later changed to dada harir.  built in solanki architectural style, the stepwell is a sandstone structure. though its grandeur is not apparent at the ground level, the moment one reaches the top of the stairs, a deep cascade of stairs and columns that plunge down several storeys with light falling on the exquisite carvings, become visible. like most other stepwells in the state, dada harir vav is a fine example of beautiful craftsmanship. it was set up with the aim of providing water during the period when there was no rain. the best time to visit the vav is late morning as it is the time when light penetrates down the shaft.
