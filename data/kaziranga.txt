kaziranga
description
one of the greatest wildlife emblems of the country, the unesco world heritage site of kaziranga national park, is famed as a home to two-thirds of the world's population of the rare one-horned rhinoceros. with the mighty brahmaputra river lapping at the fringes, the park encompasses wetlands, forests and grasslands, which shelter a sizeable population of tigers as well. moreover, the park is an abode of world-famous snakes - the rock python, the reticulated python and the king cobra, the longest venomous snake. while eastern swamp deer and wild water buffalo are common sights, if you're lucky, you can also spot a herd of elephants making their way grandly through the park. the park is surrounded by ancient temples, pristine waterfalls and lush tea estates.
