bhopal 
moti-masjid 
a historical landmark, moti masjid bears stark resemblance to new delhi’s jama masjid. it was built by sikander begum, then ruler of bhopal, in 1860. sikander begum was an incredibly progressive and forward-thinking woman of her time, who commissioned roads, bridges and other monuments like the moti masjid to be built in bhopal. due to the huge presence of umpteen mosques here, bhopal is often called the city of mosques. 
 
the mosque has two dark red towers topped by golden spikes, but its façade is white, earning it the moniker of the pearl mosque. there is a pool in the middle of the courtyard, with arched and pillared corridors on three sides of it. the masjid is an important religious building for the muslim community of bhopal and welcomes locals and tourists alike all year round.
