ashtamudi lake
fringed by swaying coconut palms and lush foliage, the ashtamudi lake is one of the most gorgeous landmarks in kollam. this pristine lake is an idyllic site to enjoy serene houseboat cruises and boat rides. the cruise takes you from kollam to alappuzha in over eight hours and gives them a unique and out-of-the-world experience. the boat ride not only offers you glimpses of abundant flora as it takes you through coconut groves, red cliffs and palms, but also introduces you to the village life of locals residing by the lake. this tranquil lake gets its name from its eight arms or channels (ashta means eight). about 16 km long, this lake finds its way to the sea through the picturesque neendakara estuary.
