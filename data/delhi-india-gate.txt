india gate
a stunning archway standing as a tribute to the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country, india gate is one of the landmarks of delhi. built with sandstone, this 42-m-high gate was the first of its kind in the national capital. the walls of the gateway have been inscribed with the names of 13,516 soldiers killed in the northwestern frontier in the afghan war of 1919, besides 90,000 soldiers of the indian army who were martyred in world war i. the base of the monument is made of red bharatpur stones and the structure of india gate is similar to france's arc- de- triomphe.
india gate is fringed by lush well-maintained lawns that act as a popular picnic venue for families. the best time to visit this monument is at night when it is bathed in soft golden lights and glistens in the dark star-less sky.
