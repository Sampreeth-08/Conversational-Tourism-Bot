khajuraho 
khajuraho-group-of-monuments 
one of the finest temple art structures, the khajuraho group of temples stands tall and proud as a testament to the skill of indian sculptors of that time. words fail to describe the beauty and elegance of the temples and one would be left wonderstruck at the human emotions depicted eloquently and unabashedly through the sculptures. 
there are about 25 temples that are spread over an area of 6 sq km. they are grouped into three categories based on their orientation: the western group of temples, the eastern group of temples and the southern group of temples. these are dedicated to both hindu deities and jain figures. 
about six of these temples have lord shiva as the main idol, eight are dedicated to lord vishnu, one each to lord ganesha and the sun god, while three are dedicated to jain tirthankaras (saints). the largest among these is the kandariya mahadeva temple, dedicated to lord shiva. it is also one of the four holy sites of shiva worship, the other three being kashi, kedarnath and gaya. 
the enrapturing beauty of the temples lies in their elaborate and intricate carvings and sculptures, which depict scenes from daily life. 
the four jain temples lie among the eastern group of temples. these include the adinath, shantinath, parsvanath and ghantai temples, which were constructed under the reign of the chandela rulers.
