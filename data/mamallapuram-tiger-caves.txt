tiger caves
while the name brings to mind a cave filled with majestic tigers, it is actually not the case. tiger caves is a name bestowed upon a couple of rock-cut temples, situated in saluvankuppam, 5 km from mahabalipuram. the name is taken from the cave temples that have a crown of carved heads of what looks like a tiger. it is believed that the animal is actually the mythological yali and the spot is called yali mandapam. it makes for a great picnic spot and the large rocks and sandy shores make it a haven for birds. since its architecture looks like an open theatre, the place also hosts several cultural events. the cave is believed to be the spot where the pallava king used to address his people from.
