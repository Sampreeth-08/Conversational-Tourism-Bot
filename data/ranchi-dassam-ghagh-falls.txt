dassam ghagh falls
split into ten gushing streams, the dassam ghagh falls is aptly named. sourcing its water from river kanchi, a tributary of the pristine swarnarekha river, the falls plunge down a height of 144 ft. the best time to visit the waterfall is between the months of october and january when it flows in all its glory.
