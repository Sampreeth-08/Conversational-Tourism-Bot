harsiddhi-temple 
the temple is one of the most popular shaktipeethas (devotional shrine where the severed body parts of goddess sati fell). situated near river kshipra, the temple carries the idol of mata harsiddhi, who is the presiding deity. tourists can also pay obeisance to the idols of goddess annapurna, goddess mahalakshmi and goddess mahasaraswati. a highlight of the temple is the sriyantra, the symbol of power or shakti, which is enshrined here. the temple architecture has some maratha influences. it has four entrances, one in each direction; the main entrance is on the eastern side. in the compound of the premises are two pin-shaped towering pillars. especially lit during navratri (a holy nine-day festival), the 726 light holders on these two pillars make for a stunning sight. apart from these two prominent pillars, there is also an ancient well within the premises that has an artistically-carved pillar adorning its top. the skanda purana, an ancient text, has an exciting legend wherein goddess chandi got the epithet of harsiddhi and thus, had this temple dedicated to her. the story goes: once, when lord shiva and goddess parvati were alone on mount kailash, demons chand and prachand tried to intrude on their privacy, and to destroy the two, lord shiva called upon goddess chandi who later killed them. 
 
according to popular hearsay, king vikramaditya was a great devotee of mata harsiddhi and regularly came here to pray.
