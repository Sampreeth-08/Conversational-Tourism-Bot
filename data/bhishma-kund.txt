bhishma-kund 
a stepwell  named after bhishma pitamaha, who is believed to have laid here on a bed of arrows created for him by his ace student arjuna, bhishma kund is one of the places in kurukshetra that bears a close connection with the great epic mahabharata. bhishma pitamaha was a figure revered by both the warring sides, the pandavas as well as the kauravas. as per legend, he had a boon that allowed him to stay alive for as long as he liked and die only when he wished to. he was wounded in the battle of mahabharata and came here to rest and watch the battle unfolding from this place. a story also relates how the kund came into existence, and many believe as bhishma lay dying here, he was parched and asked for water. to satiate his thirst, arjuna immediately shot an arrow into the ground and let loose a stream of gushing water. this is how the bhishma kund was created, as per believers. the kund also has a temple next to it.
