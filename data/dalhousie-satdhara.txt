satdhara
a popular picnic spot, satdhara falls are one of the most prominent tourist stopovers in dalhousie. surrounded by snow-clad mountains and a lush cover of pine and deodar trees, the pristine falls are made of seven springs that plunge down a height of 2,036 m above sea level. these falls are an ideal retreat to soak in natural beauty and enjoy peace and serenity. the water of the falls is believed to have curative properties as it contains mica that is known to cure skin diseases. as you sprawl near the falls, with a shy sun peeking out from behind the clouds, your senses will be enthralled by the sweet fragrance of flowers. don't forget to enjoy the lively dance of sunlight on the silver water.
