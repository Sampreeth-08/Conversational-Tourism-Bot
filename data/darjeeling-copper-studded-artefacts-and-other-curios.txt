copper studded artefacts and other curios
darjeeling is a virtual paradise for those who love artefacts and other home décor objects. here, and in kalimpong, which is located close by, visitors will find an array of shops selling all kinds of beautiful curios, which are made on copper plates studded with red and blue stones with engravings of various deities.
given the strong buddhist influences in darjeeling, the laughing buddha makes an appearance quite often as you walk down the frenzied yet exciting bylanes. other items include replicas of thangkas, wooden objects into which inscriptions and other religious subjects have been carved, brass vessels and statues, and even lovely tibetan carpets that will enrich any home. additionally, you can also pick up bhutanese paintings, folding partitions, handbags, fire screens, and woollen carpets that are usually dyed with pigments extracted from various vegetables. you can get some great deals on bhutia blankets and bedsheets, as well as masks, shoes, bedroom slippers, coats and much more.
