biryani
made from basmati rice (rice with a longer grain), biryani is found in every corner of delhi, having local and hyperlocal variations. slow cooked on a handi (pot) for hours, it is made using indian spices, a hint of saffron, and meat. the process of cooking a perfect biryani is an intricate one and requires meticulous measurements of ingredients and fine technique. the traditional method involves cooking biryani in a dum pukht, which is a slow breathing oven. all the ingredients are mixed in a large pot and cooked slowly over charcoal. the pot is sealed with dough from all sides and the steam makes the meat tender, seeping the juices in rice. there are more than 15 types of spices used in a biryani. in most variations, chicken is the main ingredient, however, crabs, prawns and fish can also be used. to give a sweet aroma to the dish, rose water, kewra water and edible ittar are also added. legend has it that timur, the turk-mongol conqueror, brought the initial recipe of biryani to india. the diet of timurâ€™s army is believed to have been a mix of rice, meat and spices that was cooked in a large earthen pot. another legend says that biryani was brought to the malabar coast by arab traders. a historical record in tamil literature mentions a rice dish called oon soru that was brought by the traders in 2 ad. it is said that this dish was made of rice, mixed with ghee (clarified butter), meat, coriander, pepper, turmeric and bay leaf.
