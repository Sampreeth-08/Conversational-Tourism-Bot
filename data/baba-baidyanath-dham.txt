baba-baidyanath-dham 
the most prominent temple in town that draws devotees in hordes every year, the baba baidyanath temple is revered as both a jyotirlinga (devotional representation of lord shiva) and a shaktipeeth (devotional shrines where the severed body parts of goddess shakti fell). the temple is among the 12 sacred jyotirlingas in the country and is dedicated to lord shiva. it also houses idols of lord ganesha and goddess parvati. prayers begin at 4 am and first the head priest worships with shodashopachar (sixteen services). then, devotees are allowed to worship the lord. legend has it that this is the place where the king of lanka, ravana, sacrificed his ten heads one by one to lord shiva. seeing this, the lord descended on earth and healed ravana's injuries. thus, shiva is called 'vaidhya' meaning doctor or healer. while there are several such legends associated with this sacred land, history too proves its importance. a mention of the temple can be found from 8th century ad, during the rule of the last king of the gupta dynasty, adityasena gupta. during the mughal period, raja man singh, the ruler of amber, is said to have built a pond here, which is known as mansarovar. the temple faces the east and is a plain stone structure with a pyramidal tower, which is 72 ft high. atop it are three compactly set gold vessels, along with a punchshula (five knives in a trident shape). there is also an eight-petaled lotus called chandrakanta mani.
