akshardham
holding the guinness world records as the world's largest comprehensive hindu temple, the akshardham temple complex is a stunning piece of architecture. sprawled over a vast area, the complex looks like a splendid heavenly city when viewed from above. the temple itself has been constructed in pink sandstone and marble and is laid amidst neatly manicured lawns, pristine waterfronts and open courtyards. it has been designed in the traditional hindu style of architecture and follows vaastu shastra and pancharatra shastra. as you stroll along the breathtaking complex, you will spot intricate carvings of animals, flowers, dancers, musicians and deities that adorn the walls. it is said that the stone used in the construction of the temple was brought from rajasthan and weighed about 6,000 tonne. the italian carrara marble used in the structure adds to the beauty of the grand temple.
some interesting features of the temple are a musical fountain, the sahaj anand water show at yagnapurush kund and the breathtaking light and sound show. starting at 7:30 pm, the show narrates stories from ancient hindu scriptures. it is a spectacular rendition that uses colourful lasers, underwater flames, water jets and video projections.
