dwarkadhish-temple 
among the most popular pilgrimage sites in the country, the dwarkadhish temple is sprawled alongside the scenic gomti creek. built of soft limestone and sand, this glorious temple seems to be emerging from the waters of the arabian sea. also, called jagat mandir or trilok sundar, it is believed to be about 2,500 years old and is said to have been built by the great grandson of lord krishna, vajranabh. the temple boasts a 43-m-high shikhara (spire) that is adorned with intricate carvings and a huge flag made from 52 yards of cloth. the sanctum sanctorum of the temple is housed in a rectangular hall with porches on three sides. 
 
the temple complex boasts two huge gateways - devotees enter through swarga dwar (gate to heaven) and exit through moksha dwar (gate to liberation). an elegant flight of 56 steps leading to the rear side of the edifice adds to the grandeur of the temple. the temple is a five-storeyed structure resting on 72 pillars and stands at a height of 100 ft. the temple's lower part dates back to the 16th century and the soaring steeple with its numerous clusters of small towers belong to the 19th century. the temple's interior is comparatively much simpler in style barring the opulent sanctum sanctorum housing the idol of lord dwarkadhish. the temple remains open for devotees on all days from 7 am to 12.30 pm and from 5 pm to 9.30 pm.
