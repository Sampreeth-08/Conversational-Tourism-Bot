dhokra
an icon of chhattisgarh, this popular craft is mostly practised in the bastar and raigarh districts of the state. tribal artisans craft bell metal (using brass and bronze) items in the traditional lost wax or hollow casting technique. dhokra is one of the oldest forms of metal casting. such products have intricate designs featuring local deities, flora, fauna, sun, moon and jungles. the process involves covering the wax is layers of clay to make a cast. liquid metal is poured into the core through a funnel that is placed at the top of the mould. when the metal (mostly brass) is cooled, the clay is chipped off and metal is polished and painted to make the final product. all the dhokra products are unique and cannot be replicated.
